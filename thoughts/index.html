            There&#39;s a new update to UQ&#39;s Philosophy &amp; Critical Thinking MOOC.
Created by the University of Queensland Critical Thinking Project (including some names you might be familiar with) on the edX platform launched by Harvard and MIT, it covers some of the big issues in philosophy and critical thinking and is intended as a resource for those keen to delve more deeply into all things philosophical and into the intricacies of critical thinking and argumentation.

            Despite what you might have heard about the Dunning-Kruger Effect, most people are pretty good at acknowledging when they aren&#39;t good at something ... most of the time. 
Lot&#39;s of people are happy to say they aren&#39;t very good with foreign languages or at mathematics.  Some people are even prepared to admit that they aren&#39;t good drivers (not us men, though).  
But I&#39;m yet to meet someone who is happy to say they are irrational.

            There are many undercurrents in the classroom, related to student and teacher assumptions, experiences, or expectations. But there is one particularly strong influence that can dramatically affect the dynamics of the classroom and how students are set up to be lifelong learners — or not. 
It has to do with the way that students — and importantly teachers — understand the nature of knowledge.  Understanding what we mean by knowledge and how we process knowledge claims is the subject of a field of...  <span class="more"><a href="/how-you-think-about-knowledge-influences-how-you-teach-and-learn">Read more ...</a></span>

            Critical thinking is a trendy term at the moment. Well, as much as anything in academia can be trendy. Critical thinking is in high demand - employers demand it, HR managers select for it, and education systems try to develop it.
Perhaps critical thinking is in such demand precisely because there just isn&#39;t enough of it.  But hold on a minute, if you&#39;ve followed those links, you might now be wondering ... what bloody hell is critical thinking exactly?

Sixty experts from across the globe working in the fields of behavioural and social sciences as well as the humanities, contributed to the research that underpins the EU Joint Research Commission report that calls upon evidence-informed policymaking not to be taken for granted.

            Democracy is a pretty good way to run a government. Sure, it&#39;s not perfect, and perhaps rule by Philosopher Kings and Queens would be better (for philosophers at least), but the fact that people who don&#39;t have democracy agitate, protest, and fight for it shows that it remains a highly desirable way of governing.
(Quick aside - I&#39;d be happy to volunteer my services as Philosopher King should anyone require it.)
This idea is best summed up in Winston Churchill&#39;s famous quip that de...  <span class="more"><a href="/why-democracy-needs-more-critical-thinkers">Read more ...</a></span>

            The use of the word “I” in academic writing, that is writing in the first person, has a troublesome history. Some say it makes writing too subjective, others that it’s essential for accuracy.
This is reflected in how students, particularly in secondary schools, are trained to write. Teachers I work with are often surprised that I advocate, at times, invoking the first person in essays or other assessment in their subject areas.

            The first thing teachers usually worry about when teaching online is what programs to use and how to drive them. Figuring out what is possible and then how to do it can be very daunting, particularly if you&#39;re not at home with computers to begin with!
Once we learn how they all work, the next concern is getting a whole bunch of content uploaded so students can access it. This can include things like Powerpoints, worksheets, videos, weblinks and so on.

            Recently, we looked at some of the confusion around critical thinking and why this leads to claims that critical thinking can&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t, be taught in schools. 
Now there are a number of approaches to teaching critical and creative thinking.  Many approaches to developing critical thinking are based on Philosophy for Children, a program that involves teaching the methodology of argument and focuses on thinking skills. 
Other approaches are based on argument mapping using a pen &amp;...  <span class="more"><a href="/what-does-a-critical-thinking-activity-look-like">Read more ...</a></span>

            There are a number of possible ways to teach critical and creative thinking in the classroom.  One approach, very common in university undergraduate courses, is to teach critical thinking as a stand alone subject focusing on a range of concepts like psychology, informal logic, and argumentation.
Another approach, best realised in the Philosophy for Children movement, is to incorporate a small session (approximately an hour per week) of collaborative inquiry into the weekly class schedule.

            There is a steady beat of assertions that critical thinking can’t, or shouldn&#39;t, be taught.  My colleagues and I are putting together a paper to answer these claims in detail, but broadly speaking these revolve around quite limited ideas of what critical thinking is (you need it to play chess?) and some quite odd inferences from similarly limited definitions and examples of critical thinking to the claim that it can’t be taught. 
The data on this is very clear. Not only can critical thinking...  <span class="more"><a href="/the-myth-that-critical-thinking-cant-be-taught">Read more ...</a></span>

            Critical Thinking is a broad church.  As an academic program, it draws from a wide range of disciplines including psychology, philosophy, and logic.  All these areas are important - descriptive psychology gives us insight into our cognitive biases and heuristics, philosophy helps us understand the nature of truth and helps to understand what it means to be rational, and logic provides the tools for making valid inferences.  
Yet amongst them, one area stands out as especially critical - argument...  <span class="more"><a href="/whats-the-role-of-argumentation-in-critical-thinking-education">Read more ...</a></span>

            Collaboration, and the reasons for it, is sometimes as poorly understood as the term &quot;inquiry&quot;. Collaboration does not simply mean a group of students working together and it certainly does not mean a group of students dividing a large task between them and reporting back to each other on its completion. 
Collaboration is critical in developing thinking for the reason that learning to think well is a bit like learning to speak a language. Just like learning a language, you cannot learn...  <span class="more"><a href="/the-how-and-why-of-collaboration-in-the-classroom">Read more ...</a></span>

            There are many different definitions of critical thinking. Some definitions suggest it&#39;s just about being able to solve problems or puzzles. Other definitions suggest that critical thinking really shines in complex discipline contexts. In other words, those people who are able to crack difficult problems must be good critical thinkers. 
Because of this perceived connection between critical thinking and complex subject matter, there are also some definitions that equate expertise with critica...  <span class="more"><a href="/what-is-critical-thinking-anyway">Read more ...</a></span>

            Few people doubt the value of developing students’ thinking skills. A 2013 survey in the United States found 93% of employers believe a candidate’s

demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important [the emphasis is in the original] than [their] undergraduate major. (source)

            Content knowledge is very valuable and is an essential part of the project of Teaching for Thinking. There is nothing about teaching thinking that minimises the importance of content. In this lesson we will try and better understand the relationship between content knowledge and thinking.
Previously, we looked at the concept of understanding and saw that this involved relational knowledge. To understand something is to know how the elements of the concept hang together, how they relate to one an...  <span class="more"><a href="/critical-thinking-vs-content-knowledge">Read more ...</a></span>

            Everyone seems to agree that critical thinking is an essential component of whatever list of 21st-century skills we might assemble. Other elements of this list include things such as creative thinking, entrepreneurship, problem-solving, decision-making, personal and social skills, and working collaboratively.
It is misleading, however, to think of critical thinking as simply one of a long list of essential skills. Critical thinking is better understood as underpinning all the other skills. Witho...  <span class="more"><a href="/arent-we-already-teaching-critical-thinking">Read more ...</a></span>

            First of all, let me make it clear that I’m not suggesting we all become dualists. As far as we know at the moment, the human brain is a sufficient (and possibly necessary) condition for the human mind. But although we might acknowledge the material or causal connection between the mind and the brain happily enough, that doesn’t mean we talk about them in the same way.
Arguably, there are good reasons to separate them when speaking in educational contexts. In this post, I will offer some reasons...  <span class="more"><a href="/minds-still-matter-in-education">Read more ...</a></span>

            In an age of fake news and social media echo chambers, Dr Peter Ellerton argues that while all people are worthy of respect, not all ideas deserve the same treatment. ​By separating our ideas from our identities, we are able to look at ideas through the lens of a brutal meritocracy, where we can discriminate between a good or bad idea without disrespecting the person who delivered it.

            Much of the public discussion about climate science consists of a stream of assertions. The climate is changing or it isn’t; carbon dioxide causes global warming or it doesn’t; humans are partly responsible or they are not; scientists have a rigorous process of peer review or they don’t, and so on.
Despite scientists’ best efforts at communicating with the public, not everyone knows enough about the underlying science to make a call one way or the other.

            How do you know what the weather will be like tomorrow? How do you know how old the Universe is? How do you know if you are thinking rationally? These and other questions of the “how do you know?” variety are the business of epistemology, the area of philosophy concerned with understanding the nature of knowledge and belief.

            All first year students at the University of Technology Sydney could soon be required to take a compulsory maths course in an attempt to give them some numerical thinking skills.
The new course would be an elective next year and mandatory in 2016 with the university’s deputy vice-chancellor for education and students Shirley Alexander saying the aim is to give students some maths “critical thinking” skills.
This is a worthwhile goal, but what about critical thinking in general?

            A new paper on teaching critical thinking skills in science has pointed out, yet again, the value of giving students experiences that go beyond simple recall or learned procedures.  It is a common lamentation that students are not taught to think, but there is usually an accompanying lack of clarity about exactly what that might mean.
There is a way of understanding this idea that is conceptually easy and delivers a sharp educational focus – a way that focuses on the explicit teaching of thinkin...  <span class="more"><a href="/teaching-how-to-think-is-just-as-important-as-teaching-anything-else">Read more ...</a></span>
