        <title>What&#x27;s the role of argumentation in critical thinking education</title>
        <description><p>Critical Thinking is a broad church.  As an academic program, it draws from a wide range of disciplines including psychology, philosophy, and logic.  </p>
<p>All these areas are important - descriptive psychology gives us insight into our cognitive biases and heuristics, philosophy helps us understand the nature of truth and helps to understand what it means to be rational, and logic provides the tools for making valid inferences.  </p>
<p>Yet amongst them, one area stands out as especially <em>critical</em> - argumentation. </p>
<p>When people hear the word argument, they often think of conflict.  Within the thinking domains however, an argument is simply a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDB5gbtaEQ&amp;t=1m10s">connected series of statements used to establish definite proposition</a>. </p>
<p>Argumentation then, is the study of how beliefs are justified via appropriate reasoning.  It&#39;s a theory of rational persuasion whereby we can accept certain claims as true if they are backed by a cogent argument.</p>
<p>To understand why argumentation is so essential to critical thinking, we need to consider why we value critical thinking in the first place.  A key objective in the <em>application</em> of critical thinking is to help ensure that our beliefs are warranted or justified. In other words, to ensure that our beliefs match reality or, in the absence of any way to confirm what the truth is, to stand confidently based on the  quality of our reasoning.</p>
<p>The account of what exactly justifies or warrants our beliefs comes from <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/">epistemology</a> - the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge.  So a useful way of thinking about critical thinking is as a form of <em>applied epistemology</em>.</p>
<p>Epistemology is a normative endeavour.  This means it is concerned with how we <em>should</em> think, as opposed to a descriptive one like psychology which studies how we <em>actually do</em> think.  It is epistemology that gives us the standards of rational inference, of testimony, and of evidence - the standards we need to answer questions like &quot;how do I know this is true?&quot; or &quot;which theory is the most plausible?&quot;.  </p>
<p>This normative component is essential because without it, we have no way of reconciling completing claims about what is or might be true.  Without it, all we can do is contradict each other when we disagree.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s in reconciling of disagreement that we can start to see argumentation connect the dots between the different subjects that inform critical thinking.  Argumentation links the normative aspect of epistemology with the social aspect of persuasion.  It gives us the tools to persuade others (and be persuaded ourselves) based on cogent reasoning rather than the tone, tempo, or volume of the person making the claim.</p>
<p>Argumentation is what makes social cognition so effective. </p>
<p>Given all this, it becomes clear that the effectiveness of any program that aims to promote critical thinking will be severely limited if it doesn&#39;t explicitly focus on student cognition and the norms of good reasoning.</p>
<p>If improving the ability of your students to think critically is important, then it&#39;s essential to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/arent-we-already-teaching-critical-thinking/">think and plan in the language of student cognition</a>.</p>

        <title>The how and why of collaboration in the classroom</title>
        <description><p>Collaboration, and the reasons for it, is sometimes as poorly understood as the term &quot;inquiry&quot;. Collaboration does not simply mean a group of students working together and it certainly does not mean a group of students dividing a large task between them and reporting back to each other on its completion. </p>
<p>Collaboration is critical in developing thinking for the reason that learning to think well is a bit like learning to speak a language. Just like learning a language, you cannot learn to think well in isolation. You must do it with others to learn how to do it well. Reasoning is far better understood, in fact, as a <em>social competence</em> rather than an individual faculty. </p>
<p>Just as language is about creating shared meaning, so too is our common rationality. It is not enough that I give you my reasons as to why I think something is the case or ought to be the case. I must also make sure that those reasons are accessible to you. </p>
<p>I need to explain why this should matter given your circumstances, and ask that you do the same for me. We need to understand what this means for each other, because we do not all process information in the same way.</p>
<p>Collaboration is critical in at least five ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Collaborative thinking allows students to understand and develop the norms of effective thinking, just as the norms of language are understood through speaking with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thinking collaboratively is a form of social cognition, in which the limits of cognition are not those of the individual mind but of the group. This can be understood in two ways. First, that social cognition helps check the biases and assumptions held by individual minds, second that the outputs of one mind can act as inputs for other minds so forming a greater cognitive complex. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Creativity is a core component of critical thinking and this is best developed collaboratively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feedback is a necessary condition for improving experiential knowledge (knowing how). In collaborative inquiry, in which thinking is shared and communication is clear and direct, the interactions between participants provide opportunities for immediate and frequent feedback on the appropriateness and quality of student thinking, either from their peers or from the teacher. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Collaborative inquiry both collectively forms and models the norms of effective thinking allowing development in critical thinking to be guided and shaped. The internalisation of what we learn socially becomes available as a resource for individual, private thinking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So while it&#39;s possible for some students to develop the skills and dispositions of a critical thinker via individual learning, collaborative inquiry is the process that necessary to develop the essential skills of social cognition.</p>

        <title>What is Critical Thinking anyway?</title>
        <description><p>There are many different definitions of critical thinking. Some definitions suggest it&#39;s just about being able to solve problems or puzzles. Other definitions suggest that critical thinking really shines in complex discipline contexts. In other words, those people who are able to crack difficult problems must be good critical thinkers. </p>
<p>Because of this perceived connection between critical thinking and complex subject matter, there are also some definitions that equate expertise with critical thinking. It is possible, however, to be working in quite sophisticated areas without necessarily employing much critical thinking at all. Critical thinking is not just about thinking in context, it&#39;s also about making your thinking itself an object of study. </p>
<p>The thing that critical thinkers are most critical about the quality of their thinking. While it&#39;s true they may be thinking about their subject area, they are also aware of the inferences they are drawing, of the need to develop broader perspectives, of the desire for clarity, accuracy and precision in their work, of needing information to be both relevant and significant and so on.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-skills">Cognitive Skills</h2>
<p>Cognitive skills include justification, analysis, interpretation, synthesis, evaluation, explanation and identify. They also include creative skills such as, speculate, generate and hypothesise. it&#39;s important to realise that things such as problem-solving and decision-making are not cognitive skills as such. These things are processes that require cognitive skills, but are in themselves something different. To effectively solve problems or make decisions, we need skills such as analysis, evaluation and justification.  Problem-solving and decision-making are processes in much the same way that creativity is a process.</p>
<p>Teaching students how to use these cognitive skills requires much more than providing them with the definition of the skill. It even requires more than simply giving them examples of these skills action. We need to think of the teaching of cognitive skills as more like coaching than either defining or illustrating. In other words, we need to get students to do these skills so that we can feedback on how well they are being done.</p>
<h2 id="affective-dispositions-or-virtues">Affective Dispositions or virtues</h2>
<p>A disposition is a tendency to behave in certain ways under certain circumstances. Our hope is that our students that will develop a range of dispositions, or habits of mind, that make critical thinking a more reflexive action. But I would argue that dispositions or habits of mind are not enough. I do not want my students to simply be reactive or habitual. I wish them to behave in ways that sometimes may go against their dispositions or habits because they know that is how they ought to behave. Knowing why one ought to behave, or think, in a certain way best describes a virtue. </p>
<p>Critical thinkers are virtuous thinkers. The virtues we wish to create include open-mindedness, perseverance, tolerance of other ideas, resilience, intellectual honesty, intellectual humility and intellectual integrity. But how do we create these virtues through our everyday interaction with students in the classroom. This is a critical question that Teaching for Thinking aims to answer.</p>
<h2 id="values-of-inquiry">Values of Inquiry</h2>
<p>The things that we value about something give us the means of constructing criteria for evaluation. Value is the root of the word evaluation. But what do we value ineffective thinking? One way to answer this question is to realise that inquiry and thinking are inseparable. When we are thinking we are inquiring and when we are inquiring we are thinking. What we value in thinking is therefore what we value in inquiry. The things that we value in inquiry include values such as clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, breath, depth and coherence.</p>
<h2 id="metacognitive-evaluation">Metacognitive Evaluation</h2>
<p>There are, arguably, two criteria that must be met if we are to say that someone is thinking critically, or at least is capable of doing so. The first criteria is that we must be able to think about our thinking, to be aware of the kind of thinking we are doing. This is generally what we mean in education when we speak of &quot;metacognition&quot;. But it&#39;s not enough that we are aware of our thinking or simply give it some attention for our thinking to be called critical. We must also have the means to evaluate that thinking. We must be able to apply some kind of criteria or standards about what makes for good thinking and recognise bad thinking. </p>
<p>Critical thinking then is both metacognitive and evaluative.</p>

        <title>Thinking about thinking helps kids learn. How can we teach critical thinking?</title>
        <description><p>Few people doubt the value of developing students’ thinking skills. A 2013 survey in the United States found 93% of employers believe a candidate’s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important [the emphasis is in the original] than [their] undergraduate major. (<a href="https://www.aacu.org/leap/presidentstrust/compact/2013SurveySummary">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A focus on critical thinking is also common in education. In the Australian Curriculum, critical and creative thinking are known as “<a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/critical-and-creative-thinking/">general capabilities</a>”; the US has a similar focus through their “<a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2010/08/02/common-core-will-require-more-critical-thinking-from-students/">common core</a>”.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is being taught successfully in a <a href="https://impact.edu.au/student-programs/critical-thinking-series">number of programs</a> in Australian schools and universities and around the world. And various studies show these programs improve students’ thinking ability and even their standardised test scores.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-is-critical-thinking-and-how-can-we-teach-it-">But what is critical thinking and how can we teach it?</h2>
<p>There are many definitions of critical thinking that are vague or ill-formed. To help address this, let’s start by saying what critical thinking is not.</p>
<p>First, critical thinking is not just being smart. Being able to recognise a problem and find the solution are characteristics we associate with intelligence. But they are by themselves not critical thinking.</p>
<p>Intelligence, at least as measured by IQ tests, is not set in stone. But it does not seem to be strongly affected by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/brainstorm/201806/how-much-does-education-really-boost-intelligence">education</a> (all other things being equal), requiring years of study to make any significant difference, if at all. The ability to think critically, however, can improve significantly with much shorter interventions, as I will show.</p>
<p>Second, critical thinking is not just difficult thinking. Some thinking we see as hard, such as performing a complex chemical analysis, could be done by computers. Critical thinking is more about the quality of thinking than the difficulty of a problem.</p>
<p>So, how do we understand what good quality thinking is?</p>
<p>Critical thinkers have the ability to evaluate their own thinking using standards of good reasoning. These include what we collectively call the <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/values-of-inquiry/">values of inquiry</a> such as precision, clarity, depth and breadth of treatment, coherence, significance and relevance.</p>
<p>I might claim the temperature of the planet is increasing, or that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon is greater than it was last year. While these statements are accurate, they lack precision: we would also like to know by how much they are increasing to make the statement more meaningful.</p>
<p>Or I might wonder if the biodiversity of Tasmania’s old growth forests would be affected by logging. Someone might reply if we did not log these forests, jobs and livelihoods would be at risk. A good critical thinker will point out while this is a significant issue, it is <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-is-why-you-will-lose-your-argument-42679">not relevant to the question</a>.</p>
<p>Critical thinkers also examine the structure of arguments to evaluate the strength of claims. This is not just about deciding whether a claim is true or not, but also whether a conclusion can be logically supported by the available data through an understanding of how arguments work.</p>
<p>Critical thinkers make the quality of their thinking an object of study. They are sensitive to the values of inquiry and the quality of inferences drawn from given information.</p>
<p>They are also meta-cognitive - meaning they’re aware of their thought processes (or some of them) such as understanding how and why they arrive at particular conclusions - and have the tools and ability to evaluate and improve their own thinking.
How we can teach it</p>
<p>Many approaches to developing critical thinking are based on Philosophy for Children, a program that involves teaching the methodology of argument and focuses on thinking skills. Other approaches provide this focus outside of a philosophical context.</p>
<p>Teachers at one Brisbane school, who have extensive training in critical thinking pedagogies, developed a task that asked students to determine Australia’s greatest sports person.</p>
<p>Students needed to construct their own criteria for greatness. To do so, they had to analyse the Australian sporting context, create possible evaluative standards, explain and justify why some standards would be more acceptable than others and apply these to their candidates.</p>
<p>They then needed to argue their case with their peers to develop criteria that were robust, defensible, widely applicable and produced a choice that captured significant and relevant aspects of Australian sport.</p>
<p>Learning experiences and assessment items that facilitate critical thinking skills include those in which students can:</p>
<ul>
<li>challenge assumptions</li>
<li>frame problems collectively</li>
<li>question creatively</li>
<li>construct, analyse and evaluate arguments</li>
<li>discerningly apply values of inquiry</li>
<li>engage in a wide variety of cognitive skills, including analysing, explaining, justifying and evaluating (which creates possibilities for argument construction and evaluation and for applying the values of inquiry)</li>
</ul>
<p>One strategy that also has a <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ847457">large impact</a> on students’ ability to analyse and evaluate arguments is argument mapping, in which a student’s reasoning can be visually displayed by capturing the inferential pathway from premises to conclusion. Argument maps are an important tool in making our reasoning available for analysis and evaluation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/311514/original/file-20200123-162210-12kfhc7.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=243&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2" alt="This map shows part of an argument in favour of giving artificial flowers over real ones."></p>
<h2 id="how-we-know-it-works">How we know it works</h2>
<p>Studies involving a Philosophy for Children approach show children experience <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17535510">cognitive gains</a>, as measured by improved academic outcomes, for several years after having weekly classes for a year compared to their peers.</p>
<p>This type of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X15569530">argument-based intellectual engagement</a>, however, can show high outcomes in terms of the quality of thinking in any classroom.</p>
<p>Research also shows deliberate attention to the practice of reasoning in the context of our everyday lives can be significantly improved through targeted teaching.</p>
<p>Researchers looking at the gains made in a single semester of teaching critical thinking with argument maps said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the critical thinking gains measured […] are close to that which could be expected to result from three years of undergraduate education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students who are explicitly taught to think well also do better on subject-based exams and standardised tests than those who do not.</p>
<p>Our yet-to-be-published study, using verified data, showed students in years three to nine who engaged in a series of 12 one-hour teacher-facilitated online lessons in critical thinking, showed a significant increase in relative gains in NAPLAN test results – as measured against a control group and after controlling for other variables.</p>
<p>In terms of developing 21st century skills, which includes setting up students for lifelong learning, teaching critical thinking should be core business.</p>

        <title>Critical Thinking vs Content Knowledge</title>
        <description><p>Content knowledge is very valuable and is an essential part of the project of <a href="/teaching-for-thinking">Teaching for Thinking</a>. There is nothing about teaching thinking that minimises the importance of content. In this lesson we will try and better understand the relationship between content knowledge and thinking.</p>
<p>Previously, we looked at the concept of <a href="/understanding-and-expertise/">understanding</a> and saw that this involved relational knowledge. To understand something is to know how the elements of the concept hang together, how they relate to one another in a logical or causal manner.</p>
<p>Understanding is certainly a type of knowledge. To understand something is to know something, but a lot of the content outlined in syllabi is more straightforward than understanding. A lot of knowledge is the kind of knowledge that can be expressed or recalled in a sentence. </p>
<p>We call this knowledge “propositional knowledge”. Examples of propositional knowledge include that the capital of Australia is Canberra, some frogs are green, humans are bipedal, force equals mass times acceleration, and Socrates was born before Plato.</p>
<p>Much assessment is designed for students to demonstrate their propositional knowledge. (We also test their understanding by asking questions about the relationship between things and by giving them problems that require a particular understanding to solve.) Propositional knowledge is also often used to structure textbooks, plans for units of work and lesson design.</p>
<h2 id="the-rigorous-curriculum">The rigorous curriculum</h2>
<p>People sometimes think that a rigorous curriculum must contain lots of content, but this is a very poor way to understand what rigorous means. Rigour is far better associated with thinking than it is with content. </p>
<p>In fact, the best way to dumb down the curriculum is to cram it full of content, for this leaves no room for intelligent thinking. The quality of a curriculum cannot be determined simply by the breath or depth of the content it contains, we must also pay attention to the types of thinking skills that it is intended to develop.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-with-knowledge">What we do with knowledge</h2>
<p>All teachers are concerned with the knowledge development of their students. But I don’t know many teachers who are happy simply transmitting knowledge. One interesting definition of a good teacher is that they can take from all their discipline knowledge that which is developmentally appropriate to the students in front of them, logically and engagingly structure and sequence it, and test for understanding along the way. But this describes exactly the function of the textbook. </p>
<p><em>Teachers need to be more than textbooks.</em></p>
<p>Most teachers are also concerned with what students do with that knowledge. What students do with that knowledge is what makes them useful in any professional or vocational sense. If simply having access to knowledge was enough, then we’d just need to make sure that we had the information we needed handy. This could be done simply by accessing our phones. So simply having access to knowledge is not enough, we need to know what to do with it.  But doing things with knowledge is one of the things we mean by thinking. So, the extent to which we value doing things with knowledge is the extent that we value thinking.</p>
<p>We can see here the value of content, for without content we would not be able to practice and improve our thinking skills. But it is not enough that we are simply engaged with content to ensure that our thinking skills develop. </p>
<p>Our thinking skills will not develop unless we pay explicit attention to them in the classroom. An important point to make here is that as we are concerned with what students do with that knowledge in the classroom, we are using, reinforcing and developing the knowledge itself. </p>
<p>This demonstrates nicely the ideas of the of the philosopher John Dewey, who considered thinking as the “method of intelligent learning”. In fact, a focus on thinking, that is, what we do with the knowledge, delivers better learning outcomes in terms of knowledge acquisition and deeper understanding.</p>
<p>So, we need to value content and we need to engage with content. But the best way to engage with content is cognitively. We need to pay attention to the type of thinking we’re doing as we engage with the content as we develop our understanding and use that understanding to solve problems.</p>

        <title>Incorporating Critical Thinking into STEM Education</title>
        <description><p>Science and mathematics are an essential ingredient for developing students who can effectively participate in a complex and diverse 21st century society.  Current and future generations face a range of wicked problems that will require innovation and ingenuity to solve.</p>
<p>Yet as essential as STEM in eduction might be, it is far from sufficient.  Today&#39;s student&#39;s need to develop much more from their education than the ability to pipette peroxide, code software, build machines and solve equations.  They also need to think critically about what they are doing and why.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s no surprise that critical and creative thinking feature heavily in <a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/critical-and-creative-thinking/">educational policy</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/employers-find-soft-skills-like-critical-thinking-in-short-supply-1472549400">the demands of employers</a>, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-intuitive-parent/201703/the-emerging-crisis-in-critical-thinking">wishes of parents</a>.</p>
<h2 id="asymmetric-transferability">Asymmetric transferability</h2>
<p>It would be convenient for everyone then (except perhaps for philosophers), if teaching students science also taught them to think critically.  </p>
<p>There must be some crossover.  After all, we teach differential calculus and Boyle&#39;s Law not because graduates need to perform optimisation by hand or calculate gas absorption on a daily basis but because this knowledge equips them with a useful perspective and ability to solve abstract problems.  </p>
<p>If it doesn&#39;t, what&#39;s the point of including things like this in a general secondary education?</p>
<p>Yet the evidence to support the claim that teaching scientific knowledge improves critical thinking <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024043708461">is</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5914/586">rather</a> <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo10327226.html">depressing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that critical and thinking and STEM are incompatible with each other.  Rather, content focused learning with a heavy reliance on memorisation and recall fails to effectively develop critical thinking skills. </p>
<p>Either we add critical thinking to the curriculum which requires us to remove some other subject (and who needs music and the arts anyway) or we must somehow integrate critical thinking into existing subject matter.</p>
<p>And given that the school day is already full, it seems sensible to look at the latter approach.</p>
<h2 id="disciplines-as-methods-of-inquiry">Disciplines as methods of inquiry</h2>
<p>We can begin to understand how we might integrate critical thinking into STEM subjects by viewing all subjects as particular approaches to inquiry.  </p>
<p>Physics asks different questions to history, chemistry uses different methods to psychology.  What makes a subject a subject is it&#39;s unique approach to investigate (including the kinds of questions they ask) but what makes all subjects common is that they seek to generate new knowledge.</p>
<p>Understanding the nature of knowledge and the justification of our beliefs is what critical thinking is all about.  It about <a href="/what-is-critical-thinking-anyway/">metacognition and evaluation</a> -- of thinking about our thinking and making judgments about its quality.</p>
<p>When we explicitly focus on metacognitive evaluation (when our thinking itself is an object of study) from within the context of subject matter, we are incorporating critical thinking into our teaching.  From this point of view, all subjects are just domain specific methods for understanding the world around us.</p>
<h2 id="question-then-justify">Question then justify</h2>
<p>There are a multitude of strategies that we might employ to develop critical thinking in STEM, but the simplest of them begin with questions.  Here are a few examples to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>What phenomenon are we investigating today?</li>
<li>Why might this be important?</li>
<li>What does the textbook say?</li>
<li>How do we know that&#39;s true?</li>
<li>What have we observed?</li>
<li>How accurate are our measures?</li>
<li>Does this amount of error matter?</li>
<li>How might we test our hypothesis?</li>
<li>What other hypotheses could also explain this data?</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these questions have simple yes/no answers.  Many are  better/worse style answers rather than right/wrong. Some can&#39;t even be answered by the best scientists today.</p>
<p>That can make them uncomfortable to ask (especially when you don&#39;t know the answer yourself). Yet this is also what makes them so transformative for student cognition.  They require students to analyse information, to evaluate it, and synthesise it into new beliefs -- the  key cognitive skills we are hoping to develop.</p>
<p>Asking and then answering these questions isn&#39;t enough however -- it&#39;s just the first step.  Students must also justify their responses to each other.  Without justification, a classroom discussion will quickly degenerate into empty talk-fest of preferences and taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> &quot;I think it&#39;s X.&quot;  </p>
<p> &quot;No, I think it&#39;s Y&quot;. </p>
<p> &quot;No, it&#39;s X!&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we begin to <em>ask</em> these question and <em>justify</em> our answers to our peers, we begin to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter we are investigating and the limitations of our knowledge.  We begin to reflect not just on <strong>what</strong> we know, but importantly on the <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> we know it.</p>
<p>Once we do that, we are beginning to think critically.</p>

        <title>Aren&#x27;t we already teaching critical thinking?</title>
        <description><p>Everyone seems to agree that critical thinking is an essential component of whatever list of 21st-century skills we might assemble. Other elements of this list include things such as creative thinking, entrepreneurship, problem-solving, decision-making, personal and social skills, and working collaboratively.</p>
<p>It is misleading, however, to think of critical thinking as simply one of a long list of essential skills. Critical thinking is better understood as underpinning all the other skills. Without critical thinking, for example, it is difficult to understand how we can have effective problem-solving or decision-making. Entrepreneurship also requires highly developed skills of analysis, evaluation and justification.</p>
<p>But not only does critical thinking underpin these other skills, those skills themselves are necessary for effective thinking. Creative thinking is a necessary component of effective thinking, and includes the constituent skills of generating and applying new ideas, identifying alternatives, and seeing or making new links.</p>
<p>Communication, collaboration and teamwork are fundamental to developing the norms of effective thinking, and collaborative or social cognition, as recognised by Vygotsky, Lipman, Kuhn and others, is recognised as a key step in improving individual cognition.</p>
<p>The personal and social skills that are necessary precursors to collaboration are also therefore a focus of an education in thinking. In short, T4T is a pedagogical focus on effective thinking does not just support the development of 21st century skills - it demands it!</p>
<h2 id="don-t-we-already-teach-students-how-to-think-">Don&#39;t we already teach students how to think?</h2>
<p>All discipline methodologies have critical thinking principles baked into them. That&#39;s what makes them effective as methods of inquiry. The methodologies have been constructed to be effective so they must have rational, critical components.</p>
<p>So isn&#39;t teaching maths or science or history enough to teach critical thinking?</p>
<p>The short answer is no! </p>
<p>Learning a discipline methodology doesn not mean that you understand the rationality behind it. Simply teaching students to solve complex problems within a discipline is not sufficient to ensure they are aware of the kinds of thinking that are necessary for the process or how that thinking can be improved.</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, without making these skills explicit it is very difficult to get students to transfer these abilities from one context to another. Content and disciplinary knowledge are necessary but insufficient conditions for teaching students to think critically.</p>
<h2 id="three-critical-questions-about-the-thinking-classroom">Three critical questions about the thinking classroom</h2>
<p>One way to assess how much your own classroom practice is focused on thinking is to ask your self these three questions - questions for which it is important that all educators have a good answer.</p>
<p>Please take the time to examine your own answers right now and reflect on how easy they were to answer. Write down your answers as we&#39;ll come back to them later.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>How do you know when students are thinking in your classroom?</strong></p>
<p>What kinds of activities do students engage in that indicate to you that they are thinking? Is it enough that they are talking with each other or asking questions of each other or of the teacher? What kinds of things do they say to each other? What kinds of questions are they asking? All of these issues are worth teasing out in some detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How you plan for that thinking to occur?</strong></p>
<p>Given that we might recognise the signs of students thinking, how do we plan for these things to occur?in what way is the consideration of student cognitive activity apparent in lesson and unit planning?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How do you give students feedback on the quality of their thinking?</strong></p>
<p>Once students begin to think, what kind of language do we have to speak with students about the quality of their cognition? Is it enough to simply check to see if a student gets the right answer, or to determine in a problem where they might have gone wrong? How is it that we can give them detailed and precise feedback on how well they analysed, justified or evaluated?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three questions are very useful to focus us on the task of Teaching for Thinking. I also recommend using these questions with your colleagues as you begin discussions with them and lead your own professional development teams.</p>

        <title>Understanding and Expertise</title>
        <description><p>The word understand is not always used very precisely. It is often seen in the phrase &quot;knowledge and understanding&quot;. But how is knowledge the same or different to understanding? Here&#39;s how we can understand that particular problem.</p>
<p>If I give you a list of people on a basketball team, it would not make sense to ask if you understood the list. You might realise that it&#39;s a list of basketball players, but that&#39;s about it. We don&#39;t use the word understand for such straightforward kinds of applications. If, however, we were to watch a basketball game, it would make sense for me to ask &quot;do you understand what you&#39;re seeing?&quot;</p>
<p>The reason this works is that understanding applies to relational knowledge - when elements of the thing were talking about are connected or related in certain ways. The names on the list are not very closely related to each other. The elements of a basketball game, however, such as the court markings, the ball, the hoop, the referee, the player and the crowd, are all interrelated. It is for elements with what we call a &quot;high degree of interactivity&quot; that the word understanding is usually reserved.</p>
<p>I might add that an implication of this is that the word understand does not represent a cognitive verb. Understanding is a state to be attained it is not an instruction that you can give to students in the same way that, for example, we might instruct students to justify or evaluate or identify or undertake any other cognitive task that we represent by a verb.</p>
<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>
<p>This definition of understand is important when we consider expertise. Experts have an understanding of their domain. They understand how all the elements of their area of speciality &#39;&#39;click&#39;&#39;or &quot;&#39;hang&#39;&#39; together. How they relate to each other and the dynamics of how the whole system works. We call such knowledge &#39;&#39;schematic&#39;&#39; knowledge, it is knowledge organised into a &#39;&#39;schema&#39;&#39;. Importantly, a knowledge schema for expertise also contains information about the kinds of problem that an expert finds in their domain, including knowledge about how these problems are solved. Expert knowledge then is not just about knowing lots of stuff, it&#39;s also about knowing how that all hangs together including knowledge about problem-solving.</p>
<p>The significance of this for teaching for thinking is that pedagogical experts require a knowledge schema that represents their understanding of the kinds of challenges and problems faced in the domain of teaching for thinking and how these challenges are met and these problems are solved.
Knowledge, whether for understanding or for the development of expertise, is core business in education.</p>
<h2 id="working-memory">Working memory</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of working with schematic knowledge is that using schematic knowledge requires very little working memory. Working memory is a very limited cognitive resource. We can only hold and manipulate a very small number of items of knowledge in our working memory. For example, if I ask you to remember the words scissor, fruit, book, dog, glass, light, and tape, and to recite them after 60 seconds, the success rate for most people would not be high. The words fade from our attention and memory and we lose both the content and their order quite quickly.</p>
<p>If students have to recall individual bits of information that, like the list of words above, seem unconnected, but are required to solve a problem, most of their cognitive effort goes to remembering that information rather than solving the problem. But knowledge that is laid down within a schema can be recalled with little or no use of working memory. It’s a kind of magic. Thinking with schematic knowledge is therefore far more effective than thinking with individual pieces of knowledge. Focusing, therefore, on student thinking, recognising the need to build effective schematic knowledge, means we will produce more effective learners.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-learning">Implications for learning</h2>
<p>We want students to develop an accurate understanding of concepts. We also want students to build this understanding schematically. In other words, we are laying the foundation for the future development of expert knowledge for our students. But the knowledge of how to do this requires expert understanding, which means pedagogical experts need to develop their own schematic understanding about teaching for thinking. Whichever way we look at it, building schematic knowledge is an essential part of the project of Teaching for Thinking. </p>

        <title>Minds still matter in education</title>
        <description><p>First of all, let me make it clear that I’m not suggesting we all become dualists. As far as we know at the moment, the human brain is a sufficient (and possibly necessary) condition for the human mind. But although we might acknowledge the material or causal connection between the mind and the brain happily enough, that doesn’t mean we talk about them in the same way.</p>
<p>Arguably, there are good reasons to separate them when speaking in educational contexts. In this post, I will offer some reasons that might make an objective, science-based study of the brain less significant than other forms of engagement with students’ minds. </p>
<p>When we talk about students’ brains we are speaking about an organ of the body. The study of the human brain, like the study of other human organs, is not primarily directed towards an understanding of any particular brain but an understanding of what they all have in common. A heart specialist is not a specialist in your heart, but in human hearts. </p>
<p>Granted the point of this generic understanding is to treat individual cases, but this can only happen after a range of inductive inferences are made from the specific to the general. It is not very scientific to work with n=1. Individual brains, therefore, are understood based on what we know about collective brains, either in how they conform with, or how they differ from, the norm. </p>
<p>In neuroscience, as in all science, experiments should be reproducible. Regardless of who is doing the investigating, we should all be able to get similar results from similar experiments. Your experience of doing the experiment should not be relevant to my experience of doing the experiment. So long as it is carried out under the same material conditions, that is all that matters. Technically, we say that science concerns itself with those things that are invariant under first person transformations. Being “invariant under first person transformation” just means our different subject experiences do not, and should not, influence the results.  </p>
<p>The ‘should not’ of the last sentence is interesting, however. What saying ‘should not’ really means is that it is not the business of science to investigate those things that are not invariant under first person transformations. But what kinds of things are those? </p>
<p>Our lives are a series of subjective experiences. In an important sense, that is all we have. Subjective experiences are those experiences that are in some ways unexaminable by others. How a banana tastes to me is unknowable by anyone else. We might hypothesis that all people taste bananas in the same way, but that does not explain the different reactions people have when they eat them. The philosopher Thomas Nagel’s essay &quot;What is it like to be bat?” makes the point that, despite knowing all there is to know scientifically about bats, no one can know what it’s like to be a bat. What it’s like to be a bat is not a question that science can answer. The same is true for all subjective experiences that humans have. No one can know what it is like for you. The claim is not really that we can not experience similar subjective sensations, or that there is no way for us to potentially understand it, or even that it is separate from any brain state, but rather that there is no way to empirically verify that it is the same experience. Science simply does not have the tools to measure such things. This is the so-called “explanatory gap” between the material world and the quality of subjective experiences that haunts many philosophers of Mind. </p>
<p>At this stage the reader may be ready to dismiss such claims using the following argument, or something like it: </p>
<ul>
<li>Premise 1: All mental states are derived from or equivalent to brain states. </li>
<li>Premise 2: Our subjective experiences, as mental states, are the result of what goes on in the brain, i.e. changes in brain states.</li>
<li>Conclusion: A sufficiently well-targeted neurological investigation into changing brain states is an investigation of subjective experience. </li>
</ul>
<p>[This argument conflates a variety of philosophical positions but my concern is not to be philosophically precise, only to provide a representation of many people’s thinking about brains and minds.]</p>
<p>Even if this argument is sound, however, it still misses the point. An investigation into the brain of a person having a clear and identifiable subjective experience is difficult to justify as providing information about what it’s like to have that experience. At best, it could only support through correlation that a reported experience is happening. An investigation into the brain is not the same as an investigation of the experience because, while an investigation into the brain can give you a full description of what is happening neurologically, it cannot give an equally full description of what it feels like. It is an investigation into a subjective experience in which the investigation itself (i.e. of the brain) is &#39;invariant under first person transformation&#39;, but it is not an investigation of what it feels like for the subject, which is not invariant under first person transformation. </p>
<p>This difficulty science has with subjectivity is a salient point since a student’s educational experiences are, definitionally, subjective ones. No teacher of any worth would imagine that all students in their classes will experience the same thing at the same time for each stage of a lesson. To believe such a thing is to believe that students are irrelevant to the learning process, and that the only thing that needs attention is the activity of the teacher, for this will determine the student experience in full. </p>
<p>What we must take as axiomatic, I suggest, is that the most important thing happening in a classroom at any given time is what is happening in a student’s mind. In other words, their subjective experiences. These experiences are not limited to their emotional reactions to events in the classroom, but include the active processes of building knowledge, constructing schematic understanding and making meaning of, and finding purpose in, their learning. Let me take this a step further and say that the act of thinking itself is a subjective experience. Thinking is something you do in as much as surfing is something you do. You can’t learn to surf from a book, and you can’t learn to think from one either. In both cases, you’ve got to get out and do the thing to get better at it. It is in large part experiential knowledge and, like all experiential knowledge, it cannot be achieved or understood solely through the exchange of objectively verifiable information. </p>
<p>Here, then, I make the distinction between speaking of brains and speaking of minds in educational contexts (I say ‘speaking of brains and minds’ rather than ‘brains and minds’ because I am concerned with a way of capturing different perspectives, not describing actual differences). When we talk of brains we are often talking of the results of our objective scientific investigations. When we talk of minds, we often mean that which contains understanding and makes meaning of a student’s subjective experiences. Both of these approaches are useful (and granted not mutually exclusive), but that does not mean that both of them are as well-grounded, at least not yet. The fact is we know far more about student’s minds than we do about their brains. Excellence in teaching predates neurological investigation. </p>
<p>There is a vast store of wisdom about student minds that should not be ignored or overshadowed by the results of empirical investigation of the brain. We would be making a grave error to dismiss brain research, but we do not know enough about the brain to provide a fully functioning pedagogical approach. Not just yet.  </p>
<p>Engaging with student minds also sounds much more acceptable (and possibly less invasive) than engaging with their brains. Speaking of minds helps to put students’ subjective experiences of knowledge construction and meaning-making at the centre of our pedagogical concerns. The insights of neuroscience are valuable and will continue to be productive and even transformative, but we should not be seduced by breathtaking images of brains in action to stop talking about minds. Not just yet. </p>
<p>While we harvest the findings of neuroscience, we should be cautious of their pedagogical implications. The field of neuro-education is an emerging one and, as such, is still sensitive to misinterpretation and to premature commodification, especially in areas such as education that are hungry for evidence-based practice. </p>
<p>A proper development of the discipline will require a sophisticated partnership between neurological and pedagogical experts, it can’t be a one-way flow of information. While we wait for the discipline to develop, we still have a plethora of empirical studies showing the value (or not) of a range of approaches and strategies. </p>
<p>This post is not, therefore, a call to abandon empirical research in education, only to not weaken our core pedagogical strength of engaging with and developing the minds of our students. Wasn’t that why we all became teachers to begin with?</p>

        <title>How to use critical thinking to spot false climate claims</title>
        <description><p>Much of the public discussion about climate science consists of a stream of assertions. The climate is changing or it isn’t; carbon dioxide causes global warming or it doesn’t; humans are partly responsible or they are not; scientists have a rigorous process of peer review or they don’t, and so on.</p>
<p>Despite scientists’ best efforts at communicating with the public, not everyone knows enough about the underlying science to make a call one way or the other. Not only is climate science very complex, but it has also been targeted by deliberate obfuscation campaigns.</p>
<p>If we lack the expertise to evaluate the detail behind a claim, we typically substitute judgment about something complex (like climate science) with judgment about something simple (the character of people who speak about climate science).</p>
<p>But there are ways to analyse the strength of an argument without needing specialist knowledge. My colleagues, Dave Kinkead from the University of Queensland Critical Thinking Project and John Cook from George Mason University in the US, and I published a paper yesterday in Environmental Research Letters on a <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f/meta">critical thinking approach to climate change denial</a>.</p>
<p>We applied this simple method to 42 common climate-contrarian arguments, and found that all of them contained errors in reasoning that are independent of the science itself.</p>
<p>In the video abstract for the paper, we outline an example of our approach, which can be described in six simple steps.</p>
<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XAp1Foj7BzY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="six-steps-to-evaluate-contrarian-climate-claims">Six steps to evaluate contrarian climate claims</h2>
<p>Identify the claim: First, identify as simply as possible what the actual claim is. In this case, the argument is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The climate is currently changing as a result of natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Construct the supporting argument: An argument requires premises (those things we take to be true for the purposes of the argument) and a conclusion (effectively the claim being made). The premises together give us reason to accept the conclusion. The argument structure is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: The climate has changed in the past through natural processes</li>
<li>Premise two: The climate is currently changing</li>
<li>Conclusion: The climate is currently changing through natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine the intended strength of the claim: Determining the exact kind of argument requires a quick detour into the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning. Bear with me!</p>
<p>In our paper we examined arguments against climate change that are framed as definitive claims. A claim is definitive when it says something is definitely the case, rather than being probable or possible.</p>
<p>Definitive claims must be supported by deductive reasoning. Essentially, this means that if the premises are true, the conclusion is inevitably true.</p>
<p>This might sound like an obvious point, but many of our arguments are not like this. In inductive reasoning, the premises might support a conclusion but the conclusion need not be inevitable.</p>
<p>An example of inductive reasoning is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: Every time I’ve had a chocolate-covered oyster I’ve been sick</li>
<li>Premise two: I’ve just had a chocolate-covered oyster</li>
<li>Conclusion: I’m going to be sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a bad argument – I’ll probably get sick – but it’s not inevitable. It’s possible that every time I’ve had a chocolate-covered oyster I’ve coincidentally got sick from something else. Perhaps previous oysters have been kept in the cupboard, but the most recent one was kept in the fridge.</p>
<p>Because climate-contrarian arguments are often definitive, the reasoning used to support them must be deductive. That is, the premises must inevitably lead to the conclusion.</p>
<p>Check the logical structure: We can see that in the argument from step two – that the climate change is changing because of natural processes – the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed by the truth of the premises.</p>
<p>In the spirit of honesty and charity, we take this invalid argument and attempt to make it valid through the addition of another (previously hidden) premise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: The climate has changed in the past through natural processes</li>
<li>Premise two: The climate is currently changing</li>
<li>Premise three: If something was the cause of an event in the past, it must be the cause of the event now</li>
<li>Conclusion: The climate is currently changing through natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding the third premise makes the argument valid, but validity is not the same thing as truth. Validity is a necessary condition for accepting the conclusion, but it is not sufficient. There are a couple of hurdles that still need to be cleared.</p>
<p>Check for ambiguity: The argument mentions climate change in its premises and conclusion. But the climate can change in many ways, and the phrase itself can have a variety of meanings. The problem with this argument is that the phrase is used to describe two different kinds of change.</p>
<p>Current climate change is much more rapid than previous climate change – they are not the same phenomenon. The syntax conveys the impression that the argument is valid, but it is not. To clear up the ambiguity, the argument can be presented more accurately by changing the second premise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: The climate has changed in the past through natural processes</li>
<li>Premise two: The climate is currently changing at a more rapid rate than can be explained by natural processes</li>
<li>Conclusion: The climate is currently changing through natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This correction for ambiguity has resulted in a conclusion that clearly does not follow from the premises. The argument has become invalid once again.</p>
<p>We can restore validity by considering what conclusion would follow from the premises. This leads us to the conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conclusion: Human (non-natural) activity is necessary to explain current climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, this conclusion has not been reached arbitrarily. It has become necessary as a result of restoring validity.</p>
<p>Note also that in the process of correcting for ambiguity and the consequent restoring of validity, the attempted refutation of human-induced climate science has demonstrably failed.</p>
<p>Check premises for truth or plausibility: Even if there were no ambiguity about the term “climate change”, the argument would still fail when the premises were tested. In step four, the third premise, “If something was the cause of an event in the past, it must be the cause of the event now”, is clearly false.</p>
<p>Applying the same logic to another context, we would arrive at conclusions like: people have died of natural causes in the past; therefore any particular death must be from natural causes.</p>
<p>Restoring validity by identifying the “hidden” premises often produces such glaringly false claims. Recognising this as a false premise does not always require knowledge of climate science.</p>
<p><img src="/media/ct-flowchart.png" alt="Flow chart for argument analysis and evaluation"></p>
<p>When determining the truth of a premise does require deep knowledge in a particular area of science, we may defer to experts. But there are many arguments that do not, and in these circumstances this method has optimal value.</p>
<h2 id="inoculating-against-poor-arguments">Inoculating against poor arguments</h2>
<p>Previous work by Cook and others has focused on the ability to inoculate people against climate science misinformation. By pre-emptively exposing people to misinformation with explanation they become “vaccinated” against it, showing “resistance” to developing beliefs based on misinformation.</p>
<p>This reason-based approach extends inoculation theory to argument analysis, providing a practical and transferable method of evaluating claims that does not require expertise in climate science.</p>
<p>Fake news may be hard to spot, but fake arguments don’t have to be.</p>

        <title>How do you know that what you know is true? That’s epistemology</title>
        <description><p>How do you know what the weather will be like tomorrow? How do you know how old the Universe is? How do you know if you are thinking rationally? These and other questions of the “how do you know?” variety are the business of epistemology, the area of philosophy concerned with understanding the nature of knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Epistemology is about understanding how we come to know that something is the case, whether it be a matter of fact such as “the Earth is warming” or a matter of value such as “people should not just be treated as means to particular ends”.</p>
<p>It’s even about interrogating the odd presidential tweet to determine its credibility.</p>
<p>Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, history and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out.</p>
<p>Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours.</p>
<p>Epistemology, therefore, is concerned with the justification of knowledge claims.
The need for epistemology</p>
<p>Whatever the area in which we work, some people imagine that beliefs about the world are formed mechanically from straightforward reasoning, or that they pop into existence fully formed as a result of clear and distinct perceptions of the world.</p>
<p>But if the business of knowing things was so simple, we’d all agree on a bunch of things that we currently disagree about – such as how to treat each other, what value to place on the environment, and the optimal role of government in a society.</p>
<p>That we do not reach such an agreement means there is something wrong with that model of belief formation.

<p>It is interesting that we individually tend to think of ourselves as clear thinkers and see those who disagree with us as misguided. We imagine that the impressions we have about the world come to us unsullied and unfiltered. We think we have the capacity to see things just as they really are, and that it is others who have confused perceptions.</p>
<p>As a result, we might think our job is simply to point out where other people have gone wrong in their thinking, rather than to engage in rational dialogue allowing for the possibility that we might actually be wrong.</p>
<p>But the lessons of philosophy, psychology and cognitive science teach us otherwise. The complex, organic processes that fashion and guide our reasoning are not so clinically pure.</p>
<p>Not only are we in the grip of a staggeringly complex array of cognitive biases and dispositions, but we are generally ignorant of their role in our thinking and decision-making.</p>
<p>Combine this ignorance with the conviction of our own epistemic superiority, and you can begin to see the magnitude of the problem. Appeals to “common sense” to overcome the friction of alternative views just won’t cut it.</p>
<p>We need, therefore, a systematic way of interrogating our own thinking, our models of rationality, and our own sense of what makes for a good reason. It can be used as a more objective standard for assessing the merit of claims made in the public arena.</p>
<p>This is precisely the job of epistemology.</p>
<h2 id="epistemology-and-critical-thinking">Epistemology and critical thinking</h2>
<p>One of the clearest ways to understand critical thinking is as applied epistemology. Issues such as the nature of logical inference, why we should accept one line of reasoning over another, and how we understand the nature of evidence and its contribution to decision making, are all decidedly epistemic concerns.
Just because people use logic doesn’t mean they are using it well.</p>
<p>The American philosopher Harvey Siegel points out that these questions and others are essential in an education towards thinking critically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By what criteria do we evaluate reasons? How are those criteria themselves evaluated? What is it for a belief or action to be justified? What is the relationship between justification and truth? […] these epistemological considerations are fundamental to an adequate understanding of critical thinking and should be explicitly treated in basic critical thinking courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour.</p>
<p>Engaging with deeper issues about the nature of rational persuasion can also help us to make judgements about claims even without specialist knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, epistemology can help clarify concepts such as “proof”, “theory”, “law” and “hypothesis” that are generally poorly understood by the general public and indeed some scientists.</p>
<p>In this way, epistemology serves not to adjudicate on the credibility of science, but to better understand its strengths and limitations and hence make scientific knowledge more accessible.
Epistemology and the public good</p>
<p>One of the enduring legacies of the Enlightenment, the intellectual movement that began in Europe during the 17th century, is a commitment to public reason. This was the idea that it’s not enough to state your position, you must also provide a rational case for why others should stand with you. In other words, to produce and prosecute an argument.</p>
<p>This commitment provides for, or at least makes possible, an objective method of assessing claims using epistemological criteria that we can all have a say in forging.</p>
<p>That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry.</p>
<p>The sincerity of one’s belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to “believe me” should not be rationally persuasive by themselves.
Simple appeals to believe have no place in public life.</p>
<p>If a particular claim does not satisfy publicly agreed epistemological criteria, then it is the essence of scepticism to suspend belief. And it is the essence of gullibility to surrender to it.
A defence against bad thinking</p>
<p>There is a way to help guard against poor reasoning – ours and others’ – that draws from not only the Enlightenment but also from the long history of philosophical inquiry.</p>
<p>So the next time you hear a contentious claim from someone, consider how that claim can be supported if they or you were to present it to an impartial or disinterested person:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>identify reasons that can be given in support of the claim</p>
</li>
<li><p>explain how your analysis, evaluation and justification of the claim and of the reasoning involved are of a standard worth someone’s intellectual investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>write these things down as clearly and dispassionately as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, make the commitment to public reasoning. And demand of others that they do so as well, stripped of emotive terms and biased framing.</p>
<p>If you or they cannot provide a precise and coherent chain of reasoning, or if the reasons remain tainted with clear biases, or if you give up in frustration, it’s a pretty good sign that there are other factors in play.</p>
<p>It is the commitment to this epistemic process, rather than any specific outcome, that is the valid ticket onto the rational playing field.</p>
<p>At a time when political rhetoric is riven with irrationality, when knowledge is being seen less as a means of understanding the world and more as an encumbrance that can be pushed aside if it stands in the way of wishful thinking, and when authoritarian leaders are drawing ever larger crowds, epistemology needs to matter.</p>

        <title>How to teach all students to think critically</title>
        <description><p>All first year students at the University of Technology Sydney could soon be required to take a compulsory maths course in an attempt to give them some numerical thinking skills.</p>
<p>The new course would be an elective next year and mandatory in 2016 with the university’s deputy vice-chancellor for education and students Shirley Alexander saying the aim is to give students some maths “critical thinking” skills.</p>
<p>This is a worthwhile goal, but what about critical thinking in general?</p>
<p>Most tertiary institutions have listed among their graduate attributes the ability to think critically. This seems a desirable outcome, but what exactly does it mean to think critically and how do you get students to do it?</p>
<p>The problem is that critical thinking is the Cheshire Cat of educational curricula – it is hinted at in all disciplines but appears fully formed in none. As soon as you push to see it in focus, it slips away.</p>
<p>If you ask curriculum designers exactly how critical thinking skills are developed, the answers are often vague and unhelpful for those wanting to teach it.</p>
<p>This is partly because of a lack of clarity about the term itself and because there are some who believe that critical thinking cannot be taught in isolation, that it can only be developed in a discipline context – after all, you have think critically about something.</p>
<p>So what should any mandatory first year course in critical thinking look like? There is no single answer to that, but let me suggest a structure with four key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>argumentation</li>
<li>logic</li>
<li>psychology</li>
<li>the nature of science.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will then explain that these four areas are bound together by a common language of thinking and a set of critical thinking values.</p>
<h2 id="argumentation">Argumentation</h2>
<p>The most powerful framework for learning to think well in a manner that is transferable across contexts is argumentation.</p>
<p>Arguing, as opposed to simply disagreeing, is the process of intellectual engagement with an issue and an opponent with the intention of developing a position justified by rational analysis and inference.
Arguing is not just contradiction.</p>
<p>Arguments have premises, those things that we take to be true for the purposes of the argument, and conclusions or end points that are arrived at by inferring from the premises.</p>
<p>Understanding this structure allows us to analyse the strength of an argument by assessing the likelihood that the premises are true or by examining how the conclusion follows from them.</p>
<p>Arguments in which the conclusion follows logically from the premises are said to be valid. Valid arguments with true premises are called sound. The definitions of invalid and unsound follow.</p>
<p>This gives us a language with which to frame our position and the basic structure of why it seems justified.</p>
<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
<p>Logic is fundamental to rationality. It is difficult to see how you could value critical thinking without also embracing logic.</p>
<p>People generally speak of formal logic – basically the logic of deduction – and informal logic – also called induction.</p>
<p>Deduction is most of what goes on in mathematics or Suduko puzzles and induction is usually about generalising or analogising and is integral to the processes of science.
Logic is fundamental to rationality.</p>
<p>Using logic in a flawed way leads to the committing of the fallacies of reasoning, which famously contain such logical errors as circular reasoning, the false cause fallacy or appeal to popular opinion. Learning about this cognitive landscape is central to the development of effective thinking.</p>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p>The messy business of our psychology – how our minds actuality work – is another necessary component of a solid critical thinking course.</p>
<p>One of the great insights of psychology over the past few decades is the realisation that thinking is not so much something we do, as something that happens to us. We are not as in control of our decision-making as we think we are.</p>
<p>We are masses of cognitive biases as much as we are rational beings. This does not mean we are flawed, it just means we don’t think in the nice, linear way that educators often like to think we do.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to think of our minds as just running decision-making algorithms – we are much more complicated and idiosyncratic than this.</p>
<p>How we arrive at conclusions, form beliefs and process information is very organic and idiosyncratic. We are not just clinical truth-seeking reasoning machines.</p>
<p>Our thinking is also about our prior beliefs, our values, our biases and our desires.</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-science">The nature of science</h2>
<p>It is useful to equip students with some understanding of the general tools of evaluating information that have become ubiquitous in our society. Two that come to mind are the nature of science and statistics.</p>
<p>Learning about what the differences are between hypotheses, theories and laws, for example, can help people understand why science has credibility without having to teach them what a molecule is, or about Newton’s laws of motion.</p>
<p>Understanding some basic statistics also goes a long way to making students feel more empowered to tackle difficult or complex issues. It’s not about mastering the content, but about understanding the process.
The language of thinking</p>
<p>Embedded within all of this is the language of our thinking. The cognitive skills – such as inferring, analysing, evaluating, justifying, categorising and decoding – are all the things that we do with knowledge.</p>
<p>If we can talk to students using these terms, with a full understanding of what they mean and how they are used, then teaching thinking becomes like teaching a physical process such as a sport, in which each element can be identified, polished, refined and optimised.</p>
<p>In much the same way that a javelin coach can freeze a video and talk to an athlete about their foot positioning or centre of balance, a teacher of critical thinking can use the language of cognition to interrogate a student’s thinking in high resolution.</p>
<p>All of these potential aspects of a critical thinking course can be taught outside any discipline context. General knowledge, topical issues and media provide a mountain of grist for the cognitive mill.</p>
<p>General concepts of argumentation and logic are readily transferable between contexts once students are taught to recognise the deeper structures inherent in these fields and to apply them across a variety of situations.
Values</p>
<p>It’s worth understanding too that a good critical thinking education is also an education in values.</p>
<p>Not all values are ethical in nature. In thinking well we value precision, coherence, simplicity of expression, logical structure, clarity, perseverance, honesty in representation and any number of like qualities. If schools are to teach values, why not teach the values of effective thinking?</p>
<p>So, let’s not assume that students will learn to think critically just by learning the methodology of their subjects. Sure it will help, but it’s not an explicit treatment of thinking and is therefore less transferable.</p>
<p>A course that targets effective thinking need not detract from other subjects – in fact it should enhance performance across the board.</p>
<p>But ideally, such a course should not be needed if teachers of all subjects focused on the thinking of their students as well as the content they have to cover.</p>

        <title>Teaching how to think is just as important as teaching anything else</title>
        <description><p>A new paper on teaching critical thinking skills in science has pointed out, yet again, the value of giving students experiences that go beyond simple recall or learned procedures.  It is a common lamentation that students are not taught to think, but there is usually an accompanying lack of clarity about exactly what that might mean.</p>
<p>There is a way of understanding this idea that is conceptually easy and delivers a sharp educational focus – a way that focuses on the explicit teaching of thinking skills through an inquiry process, and allows students to effectively evaluate their thinking.
What are thinking skills?</p>
<p>Let’s first understand what we might mean by thinking skills. Thinking skills, or cognitive skills, are, in large part, things you do with knowledge. Things like analysing, evaluating, synthesising, inferring, conjecturing, justifying, categorising and many other terms describe your cognitive events at a particular functional level.</p>
<p>Analysis, for example, involves identifying the constituent elements of something and examining their relationships with each other and to the whole. One can analyse a painting, a piece of text, a set of data or a graph.</p>
<p>Analysis is a widely valued cognitive skill and is not unique to any discipline context. It is a general thinking skill.</p>
<p>Most syllabuses from primary to tertiary level are organised by content only, with little mention of such cognitive skills. Usually, even if they are mentioned, little is said about how to teach them. The hope is they will be caught, not taught.</p>
<p>Rigour in course design is too often understood as equating to large amounts of recall of content and specific training in algorithms or set procedures. It is far less common, but far more valuable, to have courses in which rigour is found in the demand for high-level cognitive skill formation.</p>
<p>This is not to say that knowledge is not important in the curriculum. Our knowledge is hard won; we should value what we have learned for how it makes our lives more productive or meaningful.</p>
<p>But there is nothing mutually exclusive about developing high levels of cognitive skills with content knowledge in a discipline context. It just demands attention to these skills, using the content as an opportunity to explore them.
Focusing only on the skill of recall does not produce effective thinkers. CollegeDegrees360/Flickr</p>
<p>It is knowing how to provide students with these skill-building opportunities in context that is the mark of an outstanding teacher of effective thinking.</p>
<p>After all, we do not expect the scientific, cultural and political leaders of tomorrow simply to know stuff. They must also know what to do with it.
Why inquiry is necessary</p>
<p>These skills are not something students can learn just by hearing about them. They need to be given experiences in which they are required to do them. The cognitive skills involve a learning how, not just a learning that.</p>
<p>This is why it’s not possible to develop effective thinkers by relying on didactic teaching methods, in which students are seen as passive recipients of the knowledge passed down by the teacher.</p>
<p>Just as it’s impossible to learn how to surf without getting on a board, it’s impossible to master cognitive skills unless you experience the need to use them.</p>
<p>Inquiry learning provides these necessary experiential opportunities.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which inquiry is understood educationally, and it usually describes a very broad approach characterised by a focus on active student involvement in the learning process.</p>
<p>Let me provide a narrower educational definition: inquiry is a process in which students are required to utilise a range of cognitive skills to formulate and solve problems.</p>
<p>An example of a task that requires only a narrow range of cognitive skills might be one that gets students to apply a learned procedure to construct a piece of art or experimental apparatus. The cognitive skills involved might include recall with some simple application.</p>
<p>If students were asked to evaluate existing examples of the above, with a view to modifying them to suit particular purposes or situations, and to explain their processes in doing so, then the skills of conjecture, analysis, evaluation, justification and communication can come into play.</p>
<p>The second example is more indicative of inquiry learning as a result of its demand for deeper and broader use of cognitive skills.</p>
<p>Let me also add another proviso, particularly to the end of developing good thinkers: to effectively learn to inquire, students must be aware of the cognitive processes they are experiencing. That is, they must be aware of their thinking - they must be metacognitive.
Talking about thinking</p>
<p>To think about our thinking, we must be able to talk about our thinking.</p>
<p>The cognitive skills describe our thought processes and hence provide a language in which we can discuss our thinking, at least in terms of learning to think well. This also provides a language in which to give students feedback on how they are going.
Good thinkers need to think about their thinking. Candace/flickr</p>
<p>To stick with the example of analysis, we might say that an analysis was quite broad, but did not go deeply enough, or that it analysed some areas in depth, but did not extend to all elements.</p>
<p>Students can use such feedback reflectively and internalise this advice to develop their own autonomous systems of evaluation. Metacognition is therefore a necessary condition for students to improve their thinking.</p>
<p>Moving our educational focus from knowledge to inquiry allows for the development of effective thinking. Inquiry requires students to build strong cognitive skills that extend beyond simple recall or application of learned procedures into genuine critical thinking.</p>
<p>No school could teach students all the knowledge they need to survive in a rapidly evolving society. But we could teach them how to think in a way that works for the knowledge they will learn in the future.</p>
<p>That’s what learning for life really means.</p>
