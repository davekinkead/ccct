        <title>Why do humans instinctively reject evidence contrary to their beliefs?</title>
        <description><blockquote>
<p>Why do humans instinctively reject evidence contrary to their beliefs?<br>Do we understand why and how people change their mind about climate change?<br>Is there anything we can do to engage people?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are three very significant questions. They could be answered separately but, in the context of climate science, they make a powerful trilogy.</p>
<p>We understand the world and our role in it by creating narratives that have explanatory power, make sense of the complexity of our lives and give us a sense of purpose and place.</p>
<p>These narratives can be political, social, religious, scientific or cultural and help define our sense of identity and belonging. Ultimately, they connect our experiences together and help us find coherence and meaning.</p>
<p>Narratives are not trivial things to mess with. They help us form stable cognitive and emotional patterns that are resistant to change and potentially antagonistic to agents of change (such as people trying to make us change our mind about something we believe).</p>
<p>If new information threatens the coherence of our belief set, if we cannot assimilate it into our existing beliefs without creating cognitive or emotional turbulence, then we might look for reasons to minimise or dismiss it.
At odds with each other</p>
<p>Consider the current presidential election in the United States and the supporters of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The seemingly irreconcilable views of segments of the population are the result of very different narratives.</p>
<p>Each side interprets events through a lens of pre-existing beliefs that determines the meaning of new information. They might all be looking at the same thing, but they understand it in very different ways.</p>
<p>Information that one side points out can refute a claim from the other side is dismissed as conspiracy or deliberate falsehoods, or whatever it takes not to have to engage with and assimilate it.</p>
<p>More than this, sometimes we can only make sense of people who don’t share our world view by assuming they have some defect of perception or cognition that limits their ability to see things as clearly as we do.</p>
<p>After all, if they could see as clearly, surely they’d agree with us!</p>
<h2 id="climate-science-denial">Climate science denial</h2>
<p>Climate science is a typical example of this kind of effect.</p>
<p>Not only are there very different narratives people use to describe themselves and each other, but misinformation produced by some media organisations and private corporations is designed to feed into and amplify existing narratives for the purposes of creating doubt and dissent.</p>
<p>But it gets even worse. Because of an increasingly polarised political environment in many parts of the world and the intensification of the so-called culture wars, stances on topics that might once have been shared across the political and ideological spectrum are now grouped together.</p>
<p>For example, denial of the science of climate change is linked to denial of COVID-19 as a legitimate concern. We also find positions on climate science highly correlated to other, more basic ideologies.</p>
<p>Pick a topic and it’s increasingly easy to predict what someone might think about it based on their opinion about another topic in that same political basket of ideologies. The narratives are becoming more inclusive; it’s been a while since the politics of climate science has just been about the science.</p>
<p>It is also the case that belief in climate science is not a binary affair. There are many shades of belief here.</p>
<p>But all this does not mean people are immune to changing their view, even when they are deeply woven into their personal identity.
Yes, you can engage people … and change their mind</p>
<p>US musician, actor and writer Daryl Davis is a black man responsible for dozens of members of the Ku Klux Klan leaving and denouncing the organisation, including national leaders.</p>
<p>He did this through engaging them in conversation, and ultimately befriending them, in a genuine attempt to understand their world views and the deep assumptions on which they were based.</p>
<p>For Davis, mutual respect and a desire to understand each other are necessary conditions for peaceful coexistence and a convergence of views.</p>
<p>What Davis appreciated is a core principle of public reasoning, or reasoning together. If we wish others to join us in believing in something or in some course of action, we must not only have reasons that make sense to us, they must also be meaningful to others. Otherwise, explaining our reasoning amounts to little more than making another kind of assertion.</p>
<p>Creating shared meaning through reasoning together requires respectful dialogue and an intimate understanding and appreciation of each other’s world views.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-lose-sight-of-the-truth">Don’t lose sight of the truth</h2>
<p>Let’s be clear, trying to understand how someone thinks is not about meeting them halfway on everything. The truth still matters.</p>
<p>In the case of climate change, we know that the planet is warming, that the consequences of this warming are very serious and that humans contribute significantly to it.</p>
<p>We like to think of ourselves as rational creatures, and we are. But that rationality is not devoid of emotional contexts. Indeed, we seem to need emotions to be rational.</p>
<p>For this reason, facts alone are not as convincing as we would like them to be. But facts coupled with respect, understanding and compassion can be enormously persuasive.</p>

        <title>How can questioning improve our pedagocial practice?</title>
        <description><p>We all appreciate the value of questions in the classroom. They are a fundamental means of students and teachers finding out what each other is thinking. But the concept of questioning itself is poorly theorised and not well researched. </p>
<p>While questions can of course come from both teachers and students, let&#39;s just consider teacher questioning for the moment.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk of &quot;open&quot; questions, for which no definitive answer might exist, and &quot;closed&quot; questions, for which there are a limited range of possible answers. An example of an open question is &quot;Why would we value tolerance?&quot; Example of closed questions include &quot;what is the square root of 64?&quot; and &quot;Is it raining?&quot;</p>
<p>A common idea is that open questions are more effective at getting students thinking than closed questions but that&#39;s not always the case. </p>
<p>Consider the closed question &quot;Are octopuses intelligent?&quot;. While it requires a yes/no answer, it&#39;s pretty clear that the conversation would not usually stop there. We would want to explore the concept of intelligence—quite a deep subject—before we could make a judgement about octopuses. </p>
<p>So not all closed questions limit student thinking, nor do all open questions expand it. You can think of some pretty trivial open questions, I&#39;m sure.</p>
<p>There are many ways we can categorise questions but here is one categorisation based on why teachers question that is quite useful -- the <strong>RUST</strong> model of questioning.</p>
<p>The RUST model of questioning categorises four reasons for teaching questioning, including:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To test if information can be recalled (R)</strong>  </li>
</ol>
<p>When we need to find out if students know that something is the case (<em>what is?, which bit?, how many?, when did?, etc.</em>).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>To discover student interpretations and conceptualisations and to develop student understanding (U)</strong>  </li>
</ol>
<p>When we want to test relational knowledge or how students are conceptualising or integrating information we have given them into their own mental models (<em>what would happen if?, why is this aspect important?, how does changing A influence B?, etc.</em>).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>To open lines of inquiry and develop skills (S)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When we want to give students opportunities to engage in a broad and deep range of cognitive skills to provide opportunities for cognitive skills development (<em>are octopuses intelligent?, does it matter if species go extinct?, why are there 3 laws of motion and not four?, etc.</em>).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>To apply values of inquiry and give feedback on thinking (T)</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>For feeding back on the quality of their thinking and inquiry (<em>why is that significant?, could you elaborate?, can you be more precise?, what other ways of looking at this are there?, etc.</em>).</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes questioning to open lines of inquiry also develops understanding; and sometimes questions targeted to test understanding develop recall; but we are speaking here of the primary intent of the teacher. </p>
<p>Thinking about our questioning using this system can open up rich veins of inquiry into our classroom practice.  For example, these questions can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a useful tool of reflection,</li>
<li>an audit of classroom practice and </li>
<li>a planning aid in lesson development. </li>
</ul>
<p>And it&#39;s a great way to promote those professional pedagogical conversations about <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">Teaching for Thinking</a>.</p>

        <title>Why a fear of failure stops students from learning</title>
        <description><p>Fear of failure can seem like it&#39;s becoming an epidemic in the classroom these days.  </p>
<p>High stakes testing, an ever increasing pressure to perform and get top marks, or an instagram-generation growing up in an environment where only the <em>perfect</em> is made visible are just some of the many possible things contributing to this phenomena.</p>
<p>But whatever the cause, the effect is typically the same.  Fear of failure prevents students from taking action, from experimenting, exploring concepts, and having a go.</p>
<p>Simply put, a fear of failure is toxic for learning environments.</p>
<h2 id="the-psychology-of-fear">The psychology of fear</h2>
<p>The empiric evidence about the fear of failure is clear.  It&#39;s a major contributor to student anxiety, and school related stress is known to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12055">negatively affect academic performance</a>.</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, this negative influence of stress on academic performance is enhanced when combined with <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11218-004-3129-5">high academic expectations</a>.</p>
<p>A fear of failure is also associated with the use of less effective learning strategies and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12055">even cheating</a>.  These increased stress levels, loss of control, and loss of confidence, all <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pits.20149">negatively impact student resilience</a>.</p>
<p>A fear of failure often leads to actual failure.  The wrong type of failure.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that parents and students (and sometimes even teachers) conflate errors with failure.</p>
<p>The distinction I want to make here is one of time frame.  Errors and mistakes are one-off events in which the actual outcome doesn&#39;t match the expected or &#39;correct&#39; one.</p>
<p>Failure by contrast, is the result of a systematic or repeated process.  If success is the achievement of some aim or goal, failure is it&#39;s the absence.</p>
<p>So while it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to want to avoid failure, we need to make mistakes in order to learn.  Let me explain why ...</p>
<h2 id="the-epistemology-of-error">The epistemology of error</h2>
<p>One of the ways we make sense of the world is by constructing mental models.  We observe the world around us and make connections between the bits and pieces that we single out.  We then theorise about how these things affect each other and ponder <em>why is it so?</em></p>
<p>But these models are inherently inaccurate. </p>
<p>One reason for this is that many of the concepts and phenomena we are trying to reason about are too complex for our working memory.  We simply can&#39;t keep all the moving parts in our mind at one time so we need to abstract away the details and simplify our model in order to understand it.</p>
<p>Another, more important reason our models of the world are inaccurate however, is that we don&#39;t have access to what we really want to know.  </p>
<p>When we reason about science, we are reasoning about <em>causation</em> but we can only ever observe effects - we have to theorise about the actual cause from effects.  When we reason about people, we are reasoning about <em>psychology</em> but we can only ever observe behaviours - we have to attribute motivation from actions.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://archive.org/details/sciencesanityint00korz">the map is not the territory</a>.  There are many possible theories that can explain what we observe and many possible mental models we could construct around them - a problem know as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermination">underdetermination</a>.</p>
<p>We therefore have no way of knowing which possible mental models are better unless we make mistakes. When we get the right answer to a question, it&#39;s very hard to tell if our model is a good one or if we are just lucky.  </p>
<p>So we need to test the boundaries of our models in order to improve them - to make predictions and evaluate the results.  </p>
<p>Getting a correct answer to a question can certainly make us feel clever. It <em>might</em> also mean that our mental models are accurate.  But it&#39;s just as likely that we just got lucky - that our model is wrong but predicted the &#39;right&#39; answer just in this case.  </p>
<p>A broken clock is right twice a day.</p>
<p>Making errors on the other hand, gives us concrete evidence that our model is wrong and demands that we update our beliefs.  Mistakes are informative and actionable.  They are essential to the learning process.</p>
<h2 id="pedagogical-imperatives">Pedagogical imperatives</h2>
<p>Understanding the difference between errors and mistakes on one hand, and failure on the other, can positively change the way we approach teaching.</p>
<p>One important outcome of education is that students learn and apply facts and theories.  A <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/why-most-of-what-you-know-is-wrong">more important outcome</a> however, is that students also learn <em>how</em> to think critically.</p>
<p>And a very effective way of doing this is with inquiry-lead pedagogy that explicitly focuses on metacognition - an approach we call <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking">Teaching for Thinking</a>.</p>
<p>Inquiry based pedagogies demand that students have a reason to inquire - a natural curiosity, an unanswered question, or an unsolved problem.  They need what Dewey and Piaget referred to as <em>epistemic disequilibrium</em> - a cognitive imbalance between what students think they know about a concept or phenomenon, and what they observe about it.</p>
<p>Making mistakes in the classroom serves an essential role in generating this disequilibrium by motivating inquiry.  Mistakes and errors give us reasons to explore further.</p>
<p>Combined with skilled questioning, mistakes can help develop a deeper understanding of both subject matter content and metacognition.  So when students make errors or get answers wrong, they present us with a fabulous opportunity to motivate inquiry in the classroom.</p>
<p>Focusing just on being right without exploring why we are wrong hobbles both understanding and intellectual capacity.  The somewhat paradoxical conclusion then, is that in order to avoid failure, we must embrace making errors.</p>

        <title>Finding the time to teach thinking</title>
        <description><p>A common objection we hear about shifting the focus of teaching from content to inqury is that there just isn&#39;t enough time in the school day.  So let me begin by saying a focus on Teaching for Thinking does not take extra time in the classroom. </p>
<p>The fact is, <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">Teaching for Thinking</a> saves you time. </p>
<p>This may seem counterintuitive as after all, aren&#39;t we adding something to the curriculum? How can that possibly save time?</p>
<p>The answer to this conundrum comes with the realisation that Teaching for Thinking is not a curriculum project, it is a pedagogical project. In other words, it&#39;s not about <em>what</em> you teach in the classroom but <em>how</em> you go about doing it that matters. </p>
<p>Let me explain this a bit further.</p>
<h2 id="the-relationship-between-thinking-and-learning-">The relationship between thinking and learning.</h2>
<p>While it&#39;s true that some knowledge can be passively received, much of what is worth knowing has to be actively constructed. Knowledge of this sort cannot be separated from the knower. </p>
<p>This is not because knowledge about the world is always subjective, but because <em>knowing</em> is. The way each student makes sense of what we teach them, including how they build mental models and conceptual structures of key ideas and understanding is unique to them. What we need to understand is that the way students undertake this cognitive activity is what we mean by thinking.  </p>
<p>Thinking is a necessary condition for quality learning. A focus on thinking, therefore, is the way to optimise student learning.</p>
<p>Now, students can learn a lot from their teachers but they also need to be self-directed in their learning. This means they need a set of skills and dispositions that allow them to guide their own inquiry. These skills and dispositions are those associated with thinking well. </p>
<p>Teaching for Thinking helps develop autonomous learners.  It helps students frame and ask their own questions to guide their own inquiry.  And when students learn via their own inquiry, they develop a deeper understanding about the subject and content matter that they are inquiring about.</p>
<p>Meaningful learning doesn&#39;t require any more classroom time than simple memorisation and recall.</p>
<h2 id="three-critical-questions">Three critical questions</h2>
<p>The kinds of thinking we want students to do is not mysterious. We want them to analyse, explain, justify, evaluate, synthesis, interpret and so on. These are the <em>cognitive skills</em> that occupy the attention of many syllabus writers and assessment designers. </p>
<p>As classroom teachers concerned with a focus on student thinking, we need to ask the three questions that frame all our cognitive work:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>How to do you know students are thinking in your classroom?</em> What are the behaviours that you can associate with these cognitive skills? How do you create opportunities for students to do them — remembering that thinking is <em>action</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How do you plan for this thinking to occur?</em> Apart from sequencing content, what do you do that ensures students will be engaging in a wide and deep range of cognitions?</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How do you feed back on the quality of student thinking?</em> Beyond telling a student that they have something correct of not, or giving feedback in terms only of the completion of a task, how are you giving them feedback on the quality of their analysis, evaluation, justification, and so on? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Proposing these questions to colleagues and helping them to develop answers to them is an effective way to promote and develop a pedagogical focus on <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">Teaching for Thinking</a>. It is also a way of sharing best practice and coming to understand the relationship between thinking and learning.</p>
<p>More than this though, it provides examples of how Teaching for Thinking does not take extra time in the classroom, but integrates thinking and learning as a pedagogical approach to the benefit of both.</p>

        <title>Understanding Pedagogical Change</title>
        <description><p>School leaders channel vast amounts of time, energy and resources towards achieving pedagogical change. However, enacting the required shift in teaching practice is complex, extending beyond teaching tools and strategies. Changes in classroom practices are necessary, yet they are the by-product of a more significant personal transformation. </p>
<p>To gain further insights into this leadership challenge, understanding the role of teaching strategies in successful pedagogical change is an important consideration. </p>
<p>The nature of change is disruptive; the process causes something to become different. When we talk of pedagogical change, what is the something that needs to become different? Meaning, what is the essential change that needs to occur within the teacher for meaningful pedagogical growth?  </p>
<p>A typical response to this question is the classroom strategies displayed by teachers. There is a certain appeal to this answer because, through classroom observations, the modification in teaching methods is easily identifiable. An example of this could be when a teacher asks for help with a reoccurring problem they are having during their lessons. A respected colleague provides some advice about what to do. The teacher follows the guidance, and the issue disappears. Job done.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the complexities of teaching cannot be reduced to strategies alone. True, this is a type of change, but it is not the something that needs to shift for meaningful pedagogical development. Observable variations in classroom practices are necessary, but they are far from sufficient.  The strategy is just the tip of the iceberg; we need to go deeper to appreciate the scope and scale of the required shift. </p>
<p>The teacher may have learnt how to use a new method, but it is unclear if they understand why the strategy was effective. Shifting from copying a teaching technique to the intentional application of teaching methods requires in-depth pedagogical knowledge. This shift can only be realised if the teacher understands why they apply specific strategies in certain circumstances. </p>
<p>Thinking in this manner leads to intentionality - the purposeful selection of particular strategies. The need to comprehend the underlying reasons for success or failure leads to further questions such as when is the strategy most effective and how could this method be enhanced in the future. </p>
<p>The spirit of “just do it” isn’t enough; teaching is much more than mimicry. Teachers need to do more than adopt strategies; they need to adapt them to cater to the needs of their students.</p>
<p>A teacher&#39;s pedagogical understanding is the defining feature of their expertise; it is what distinguishes education from other disciplines. As educators, we should celebrate this difference as exploring and solving teaching and learning problems is a major contribution we make to society. </p>
<p>In terms of teacher development, when we narrow our perspective of change to strategies alone, we undervalue the significance of our profession by limiting and restricting our capacity for pedagogical excellence.  </p>
<p>Successfully navigating the treacherous waters of pedagogical change is tricky. Sharing alternative teaching methods is essential, but shallow if we fail to comprehend why such strategies are effective. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the hope and challenge of pedagogical change is the cultivation of teaching excellence, fostering highly skilled teachers who trust their professional judgements. The aim is the creation of experts, not the development of teachers who are all tip and no iceberg.</p>

        <title>Why most of what you know is wrong</title>
        <description><p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of radiation before - the emission of energy and its transmission through space or matter.  When radiation has enough energy, it can break the chemical bonds within molecules and atoms and release particles at very high speed.  This is known as ionising radiation and it can be quite nasty to organic life like plants and animals.</p>
<p>One way to measure radiation (or radioactive decay more specifically) is by its half-life - the time it takes for half the energy of some unstable substance to break down and be released as radiation.</p>
<p>The half-life of oxygen is infinity - it is stable and doesn&#39;t normally decay.  </p>
<p>The half life of Uranium-238 is nearly 4.5 billion years while the isotopes it decays into, Thorium-230 and Radium-226, have half-lives of 1000&#39;s of years - hence the concern about nuclear waste.</p>
<p>And the half-life of Oganesson-293 (first synthisised in 2002) is just 5 milliseconds - half of it decays every 1/200th of a second.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with the price of tea in China - or even <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">critical thinking</a> for that matter? Quite a lot actually.</p>
<h2 id="the-growth-of-knowledge-is-compounding">The growth of knowledge is compounding</h2>
<p>In 1950, there were about 60,000 different academic journals in publication.  Today there are over 1,000,000.  The amount of new knowledge produced <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2909426/">is growing exponentially at roughly 5% per year</a> meaning the amount of new knowledge in the world doubles about every 15 years.</p>
<p>Some of this new knowledge is novel - it concerns things we didn&#39;t know about before.  But much of it represents the reversal of old knowledge.</p>
<p>Remember Pluto (the celestial body, not the cartoon dog, nor the philosopher)?  When I went to school it was a planet.  <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/dwarf-planet-pluto-astronomy/">Now it isn&#39;t</a>.</p>
<p>Are carbs good for weight loss? First they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0801698">were</a>, then they <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1014296">weren&#39;t</a>, then they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nutd20162">were</a> and then they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527511">weren&#39;t</a>.</p>
<p>Things that we once thought were true, turn out to be not so true after all. And sometimes, they even become true again. </p>
<p>The faster new knowledge is created, the faster old knowledge becomes out-dated.</p>
<p>This is what has become known as the half-life of knowledge - the time it takes for half of a body of facts to be superseded or found to be untrue.</p>
<p>This phenomenon occurs across all domains of knowledge - from anthropology to zoology and from engineering to psychology.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/10/why_the_replication_crisis_seems_worse_in_psychology.html">Especially psychology</a>!</p>
<p>Like radioactive decay, we don&#39;t know when or which particular fact (or atom) will decay.  But we do know how long it will take half of them to decay.</p>
<h2 id="textbooks-may-age-but-expert-teaching-is-timeless">Textbooks may age but expert teaching is timeless</h2>
<p>The average person lives for about 80 years.  The half-life of knowledge is about a quarter of that.  By the time you die, only a half of a half of a half of a half (&lt;7%) of the things that were true at your birth will still be true when you pass away.</p>
<p>Knowledge isn&#39;t static.  It isn&#39;t some eternal collection of facts that can be chiseled into stone. Rather, knowledge is highly dynamic as what is &#39;true&#39; now will likely change in the future.</p>
<p>The unfortunate consequence of humanity&#39;s rapidly expanding knowledge is this - most of what we learn over our lifetimes will turn out to be wrong. That also means much of the content that we teach will turn out to be wrong too.</p>
<p>This would be a major problem if we viewed teaching as merely transferring knowledge to students and our role as teachers as &quot;sages on the stage&quot; rather that &quot;guides on the side&quot;.</p>
<p>Sequencing and present content matter is the job of a textbook - teaching demands much more than this.  As educators, we need to teach our students how to think, not what to think.</p>
<p>The pedagogical expertise of teaching involves understanding how students think about subject matter, and of the interaction of the content with the student&#39;s present needs and capabilities.</p>
<p>So is Pluto a planet? Maybe.  But by helping students understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_planet">competing definitions of different astronomers</a>, and having them create and apply their own criteria for planethood, we can answer more confidently no (and at the same time <a href="/what-does-a-critical-thinking-activity-look-like/">teach them to think more critically</a>).</p>
<p>Are carbs bad for weightloss?  Maybe.  But by helping students understand the nature of scientific inquiry, the provisional nature of most scientific truths, and how to survey scholarly literature to find meta-analyses on numerous randomised controlled experiments, we can answer more confidently ... maybe.</p>
<p>By teaching our students how to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-how-to-think-is-just-as-important-as-teaching-anything-else/">think critically</a>, how to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-how-to-think-is-just-as-important-as-teaching-anything-else/">effectively analyse and evaluate claims</a>, how to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/how-students-can-collaborate-online/">reason collaboratively</a>, and the importance of the <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/values-of-inquiry/">values and virtues of inquiry</a>, we can make sure that their education ages better than we do.</p>

        <title>Critical thinking is so much more than being smart</title>
        <description><p>The Federal Government recently announced a major shake-up of university fees – it included a decision to more than double the cost of studying humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>It sparked furious debate, including about the important role these kinds of degrees play in helping to develop critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Do we as a community and society still value critical thinking? Can it help us tell fact from fiction?</p>
<p>Should we value it more? Peter Ellerton, Clark Wight from Guildford Grammar Preparatory School, and Jess Strutt from the ABC explore in the latest episode of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radio/perth/programs/focus/critical-thinking/12458198">On Focus</a></p>

        <title>Philosophy &amp; Critical Thinking MOOC</title>
        <description><p>There&#39;s a new update to UQ&#39;s <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/philosophy-and-critical-thinking">Philosophy &amp; Critical Thinking MOOC</a>.</p>
<p>Created by the University of Queensland Critical Thinking Project (including some names you might be familiar with) on the edX platform launched by Harvard and MIT, it covers some of the big issues in philosophy and critical thinking and is intended as a resource for those keen to delve more deeply into all things philosophical and into the intricacies of critical thinking and argumentation. </p>
<p>The first version was made a few years ago, but the UQCTP team have released a new edition with two new modules build especially for the QCAA Philosophy and Reason syllabus. The new modules are God, and Moral and Political Philosophy.  </p>
<p>There are many videos, most of which are pretty quirky and a lot of text that goes deeper into all the relevant theories and philosophies. Plus there are in-depth interviews with some of the best philosophers around on a wide range of topics. </p>
<p>I know a lot of them are regularly used by teachers in helping their students understand key concepts. They also star teachers and students of Philosophy and Reason. </p>
<p>A special section has also been made for teachers, featuring Yael Leibovitch, Nathan Pickels and Kirsti Ellerton — all teachers of Philosophy and Reason — focusing on assessment, ways of thinking and working and the tools of logic. Teachers can also claim professional development hours for completion of the MOOC. </p>
<p>The course has had nearly 100 000 people enrol over time and the new version just started has nearly 10 000 already from over 150 countries!</p>

        <title>Rationality &amp; intellectual humility</title>
        <description><p>Despite what you might have heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>, most people are pretty good at acknowledging when they aren&#39;t good at something ... most of the time. </p>
<p>Lot&#39;s of people are happy to say they aren&#39;t very good with foreign languages or at mathematics.  Some people are even prepared to admit that they aren&#39;t good drivers (not us men, though).  </p>
<p>But I&#39;m yet to meet someone who is happy to say they are irrational.</p>
<p>Yet despite this, for many of those who think they are rational (at least most of the time), there are clear signs that indicate when they are not - and a clear sign of irrationality is a lack of intellectual humility.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-humility-is-much-more-than-just-a-laudable-virtue-">Intellectual humility is much more than just a laudable virtue.</h2>
<p>Humility <em>is</em> a laudable virtue.  When you think of a humble person, who do you think of and what traits do they exhibit?  They certainly aren&#39;t going to be braggarts or brimming with over-confidence.  They won&#39;t be showing off, advertising their successes, or ignoring their failures.  </p>
<p>Rather, they are likely to avoid these behaviours because they are acutely aware of their own flaws and limitations, their strengths as well as their weaknesses.  A humble person is someone who is willing to honestly assess their own abilities and therefore can do so more accurately.</p>
<p>Intellectual humility extends this concept to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/how-do-you-know-that-what-you-know-is-true-thats-epistemology/">epistemic domains</a>, which is to say into the area of  <em>knowledge claims</em>. Intellectual humility is a virtue because it helps us avoid errors of over-confidence in stating what we think is the case, or what we know. Intellectual humility is a virtue because it leads to more accurate beliefs more often. </p>
<p>But intellectual humility is much more than just a virtue. It is an essential condition for rationality.</p>
<h2 id="rational-beliefs-conform-to-reason-irrational-beliefs-don-t-">Rational beliefs conform to reason, irrational beliefs don&#39;t.</h2>
<p>Being rational <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational">means being reasonable</a> which in turn <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reasonable">means being <em>agreeable</em> to reason</a>. And it is this agreeableness that is so important.  Being agreeable to reason requires us to give reasons for our beliefs and listen to the reasons that others give for theirs. </p>
<p>Simply put, being <em>agreeable to reason</em> means that the beliefs we hold should conform to the reasons we have for those beliefs.  Rational beliefs move from supporting reasons to supported belief, from evidence to conclusion - a process we call <em>justification</em>.</p>
<p>So, being agreeable to reason requires that we change our beliefs as new information or evidence comes to light.  Being rational means being ready to change our mind.</p>
<p>Yet many people reason in the opposite direction. They start with a belief and then seek out pieces of evidence that support it while ignoring any conflicting evidence - a process we call <em>rationalisation</em> (which is a rather unfortunate name as there isn&#39;t much rational about it).</p>
<p>As humans, we can&#39;t help but interpret new information and make sense of the world through the lens of our existing beliefs. Unfortunately, this can also result in a strong tendency for prior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_bias">belief bias</a>. Existing beliefs tend to irrationally persevere even in the face of good reasons to change them.</p>
<p>But by cultivating the virtue of intellectual humility, both within ourselves and within our students, we can overcome our tendency for belief bias.  By being willing to admit when we are wrong and to change our minds when new evidence arises, we can avoid acting dogmatically.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-are-not-prepared-to-change-your-mind-then-you-are-by-definition-irrational-">If you are not prepared to change your mind then you are, by definition, irrational.</h2>
<p>So, right now I&#39;d like you to think about a belief you strongly hold and one you are confident you are right about ... say the moral permissibility of abortion, or our obligations to deal with climate change.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself ... are you prepared to change your mind about this subject? What evidence would it take to change your belief?</p>
<p>Because if you aren&#39;t prepared to change your mind, then you&#39;re irrational by definition. But then you wouldn&#39;t be reading this article, would you?</p>

        <title>How you think about knowledge influences how you teach and learn</title>
        <description><p>There are many undercurrents in the classroom, related to student and teacher assumptions, experiences, or expectations. But there is one particularly strong influence that can dramatically affect the dynamics of the classroom and how students are set up to be lifelong learners — or not. </p>
<p>It has to do with the way that students — and importantly teachers — understand the nature of knowledge.  Understanding what we mean by knowledge and how we process knowledge claims is the subject of a field of philosophy known as <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/how-do-you-know-that-what-you-know-is-true-thats-epistemology">epistemology</a>.</p>
<p>Epistemology is quite a complex area, but let me present a simplified version of how we understand knowledge and knowledge claims. On the one hand we might see knowledge as fixed, eternal, and as existing separate from the knower. Let me call this an absolutist epistemology. </p>
<p>In an absolutist epistemology, inquiry is all about accepting that the truth is out there and that it is our job to discover it. That sounds pretty straightforward, and perhaps you think that&#39;s how modern inquiry systems work. But, as we know, life is often more complex than it seems.</p>
<p>Another way of understanding knowledge and knowledge claims is to think of knowledge as tentative, evolving and intimately connected with the knower. I&#39;ll call this an evaluative epistemology because the main focus in such a system is not so much on acknowledging something as true as it is on justifying why we ought to believe it. In other words, how to evaluate the credibility of knowledge claims.</p>
<p>This might all sound a bit technical, but it has some significant implications for how we teach and learn. </p>
<p>If we have an absolutist epistemology, then it follows that knowledge is best passively received. After all if the truth has been found, surely the most important thing is to make people aware of it. In such a model the teacher is seen as a knowledge broker, transferring knowledge from places where it is in excess to where it is in deficit, i.e. from experts and teachers to students. </p>
<p>Thinking about knowledge like this also leads to a compliance model of education, in which students can achieve knowledge by carrying out the prescribed steps set out by the teacher.</p>
<p>If we have an evaluative epistemology, however, then we understand that knowledge is not so much passively received as it is constructed by the student. It is continually tested and evaluated to see if it is worthy of acceptance. This is not to deny the existence of some kind of reality, but rather to appreciate that our interaction with that reality is something that we have to interpret carefully and rigorously. </p>
<p>In such a model the teacher is not so much a knowledge broker as a co-creator of knowledge with the student, leading to a far more collaborative approach to learning in the classroom.</p>
<p>Ultimately the classroom has either an environment in which the transfer of knowledge is the priority, or an environment in which inquiry is valued because we understanding that inquiry itself is the means of production of knowledge. </p>
<p>But if we focus solely on the transfer of knowledge, then we cut off students from the means of production of knowledge, which seems to be and extremely odd outcome for an educational institution.</p>
<p><a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">Teaching for Thinking</a> is best achieved using an evaluativist epistemology, in which  justifications of knowledge claims takes precedence over simply accepting claims from authority. Critically, this must be the case on the part of students <em>and</em> teachers.</p>
<p>As a colleague once said to me, you can&#39;t have a thinking classroom without a thinking staffroom.</p>

        <title>What do experts mean when they talk about critical thinking?</title>
        <description><p>Critical thinking is a trendy term at the moment. Well, as much as anything in academia can be trendy. Critical thinking is in high demand - employers <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bosses-seek-critical-thinking-but-what-is-that-1413923730">demand it</a>, HR managers <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/list-of-soft-skills-2063770#critical-thinking">select for it</a>, and education systems try to <a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/education-for-a-changing-world/thinking-skills/critical--thinking">develop it</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps critical thinking is in such demand precisely because there just <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/when-employers-demand-skills-professors-cannot-define">isn&#39;t</a> <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo10327226.html">enough</a> <a href="https://qz.com/1488854/are-schools-teaching-enough-critical-thinking-skills/">of it</a>.  But hold on a minute, if you&#39;ve followed those links, you might now be wondering ... what bloody hell <em>is</em> critical thinking exactly?</p>
<h2 id="the-cheshire-cat">The Cheshire Cat</h2>
<p>Critical thinking has been called the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137378057_25">Cheshire Cat of Education</a>. It is hinted at in all disciplines but appears fully formed in none. As soon as you push to see it in focus, it slips away.</p>
<p>Ask three academics to explain what critical thinking is and you are likely to get five different answers.</p>
<p>These definitions range from the long ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action” (<a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766">Scriven and Paul 1987</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> ... to the short ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reasonable inquiry and argument” (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X15569530">Kuhn 2015, p. 47</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> ... from something you do ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Skillful, responsible thinking that is conducive to good judgment because it is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is self-correcting” (<a href="http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198809_lipman.pdf">Lipman 1988</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> ... to dispositions you have ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one&#39;s experiences&quot; (<a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4469312M/An_experiment_in_the_development_of_critical_thinking">Glaser 1941</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now there&#39;s nothing wrong with any of these definitions by themselves.  A problem arises however, when we try to talk to each other using the same word to mean different things.  An even bigger problem arises when we try to teach or develop &quot;critical thinking&quot; but have different or conflicting definitions of it.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t learn to ride a bike by reading a book.  Skills demand a different mode of education compared to content knowledge, and dispositions and virtues require a different mode again.</p>
<p>How we define critical thinking matters because it determines the nature of our pedagogy.  And from the definitions above, it isn&#39;t clear how we should develop and teach critical thinking.</p>
<h2 id="how-critical-thinking-is-used">How &quot;critical thinking&quot; is used</h2>
<p>To get some more clarity on the issue, we  decided to dive deeper into the scholarly literature - to see what academics actually thought critical thinking was. We randomly sampled 100 peer-reviewed journal articles from a list of studies published in the last 10 years that contained the phrase <em>&#39;critical thinking&#39;</em> in their title.  </p>
<p>We then ran the definitions of critical thinking contained in these papers through some text analysis to identify some common themes and differences. When we look at a word cloud of these definitions, clear themes emerge.</p>
<p><img src="https://criticalthinking.org.au/media/critical-thinking-word-cloud.png" alt="Word cloud of critical thinking definitions"> </p>
<p>Amongst academics, critical thinking was primarily conceptualised as either a skill (33%), an ability (26%), a process (26%), or often a combination of these (15%).  Critical thinking is concerned with information (29%) or knowledge (25%) which is evaluated (39%), analysed (36%), inferred from (28%) or otherwise judged (28%).  Sometimes definitions required this to be purposeful (18%) and/or self-regulated (14%), and a few mentioned metacognition (3%).</p>
<p><img src="https://criticalthinking.org.au/media/ct-definitions-plot.png" alt="Themes in critical thinking definitions"></p>
<h2 id="a-critical-thinking-definition-we-can-use">A critical thinking definition we can use</h2>
<p>Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">blind men in the dark</a> each of these definitions captures some essence of critical thinking but fails to adequately capture the whole of it. The problem as mentioned earlier, is that these definitions don&#39;t make it clear how we should develop and teach critical thinking.</p>
<p>Rather than debate the relative merits of these definitions, we&#39;re going to propose a pragmatic one - a usable definition of critical thinking that <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/thinking-about-thinking-helps-kids-learn-how-can-we-teach-critical-thinking">helps us teach and develop it in students</a>.</p>
<p>So here it is ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Critical thinking is metacognitive evaluation according to norms of rationality.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s a bit of a mouthful so let&#39;s unpack it bit by bit.  <em>Cognition</em> means thinking and <em>meta</em> means relating to itself so <em>metacognition</em> is just <em>thinking about our thinking</em>.  </p>
<p><em>Evaluate</em> means to make a judgment about merit. To judge, we need some kind of standard or criterion (the <em>value</em> in evaluate). That standard is rationality.  And by <em>rationality</em> we  just mean the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality">classical idea</a> of alignment of belief with action and belief with reasons for those beliefs.</p>
<p>So to be a critical thinker is to be someone who thinks about their thinking, about why they believe those things, about what standards are appropriate for believing those things are &#39;true&#39; or &#39;correct&#39;, and evaluates their own thinking to see if their beliefs are justified.</p>
<p>This account of critical thinking makes the the job of teaching students to think critically much clearer.  It means the first step is to help students become aware of what they are thinking using the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137378057_25">language of cognition</a> and <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/values-of-inquiry/">values of inquiry</a>.</p>
<p>The next step is to help students evaluate their thinking.  This might involve <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/whats-the-role-of-argumentation-in-critical-thinking-education/">argumentation</a>, logic, dialogue, <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/the-how-and-why-of-collaboration-in-the-classroom">collaborative inquiry</a>, psychology, and the <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/incorporating-critical-thinking-into-stem-education/">nature of science</a>.  Importantly, it requires that students reflect on what counts as <em>good reasons for belief</em> so that they can justify their own beliefs to themselves and others.</p>
<p>We&#39;re pretty sure this won&#39;t be the final word what critical thinking is.  But if we conceptualise critical thinking as simply <em>metacognitive evaluation according to norms of rationality</em>, then we can use this understanding to better teach it.</p>

        <title>Why democracy needs more critical thinkers</title>
        <description><p>Democracy is a pretty good way to run a government. Sure, it&#39;s not perfect, and perhaps rule by Philosopher Kings and Queens would be better (for philosophers at least), but the fact that people who don&#39;t have democracy agitate, protest, and fight for it shows that it remains a highly desirable way of governing.</p>
<p>(Quick aside - I&#39;d be happy to volunteer my services as Philosopher King should anyone require it.)</p>
<p>This idea is best summed up in Winston Churchill&#39;s famous quip that <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/the-worst-form-of-government/">democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others we&#39;ve tried</a>. Democracy, viewed this way, is the least bad option for ruling.  </p>
<p>But what is about democracy that makes it <em>good</em> - or less bad than the others?</p>
<p>Over the last 2500 years, philosophers and political theorists have put forward a lot of explanations to try and answer this question. One is that democracy is good because it is one of the few systems of government to rely on consent. Societies need rules to properly function and often, people disagree with particular rules.  </p>
<p>But if everyone gets a say in the creation of these rules, then at least we&#39;ve agreed to play <em>by</em> the rules, even if we disagree with them.</p>
<p>A similar explanation is based on equality and egalitarianism. We would all prefer to be the boss - benevolent dictators shaping the world as we see best.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), we can&#39;t all be dictators. In fact, the only system of government that rational dictators with equal power would agree to is to <em>no more than an equal say for everyone else</em>.  So rational egoism makes us accept equality amongst our fellow citizens - one vote, one value.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful justification of democracy though, is <em>epistemic</em> - that democracies tend to make better choices than other forms of government. This is most famously articulated in what&#39;s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem">Condorcet&#39;s Jury Theorem</a> and sometimes called the Wisdom of the Crowds.</p>
<h2 id="democracy-s-epistemic-superpower">Democracy&#39;s epistemic superpower</h2>
<p>CJT is a mathematical proof that shows that people who on average each have a better than even chance of being correct in a decision increase the chance of a correct majority decision when deciding as a group. The chance that the majority vote is correct increases as the number of voters increases.</p>
<p>To add some real figures, it means that if only 1000 people, each of whom on average have just a 51% chance of being right on some issue, then a majority vote of the group will have 99.999% certainty of being right.</p>
<p>That. Is. Amazing.  </p>
<p>Democracy has the power to turn the knowledge of a group of &#39;average&#39; people into something better than an expert!</p>
<p>Of course, there are some important assumptions behind that result.  One is that we are asking the right questions.  CJT only works if we are asking questions that <em>can</em> be answered correct (as opposed to questions about competing values which may or may not have a &#39;right&#39; answer).</p>
<p>The key assumption however, is that the chance of each voter being correct is independent of whether other voters are correct.</p>
<p>No-one reasons perfectly and we all make mistakes. But if the errors in our reasoning are different (or more accurately &quot;statistically independent&quot;) then these reasoning errors will cancel each other out when we reason as a group.</p>
<p>So if we are trying to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/08/07/429720443/17-205-people-guessed-the-weight-of-a-cow-heres-how-they-did?t=1591172950551">estimate the weight of a cow</a> at a fair, or how many jelly beans are in a jar, then some of us might overestimate and some of us might underestimate, while most of us will be wildly incorrect.</p>
<p>Yet when we aggregate the results of everyone and average them out, these over- and underestimates balance out and the collective result of a group of &#39;just better than average&#39; people will far exceed the results of individual experts.</p>
<p>But if the reasoning errors of individuals are <em>systematic</em> rather than independent, we have a problem. If we all have a tendency to underestimate the number of jelly beans in the jar (or overestimate the success of some economic policy) then the group decision will be much worse than both the individual expert and even the average voter.</p>
<p>CJT is symmetric - it works in both directions.  If those 1000 voters are only 49% likely to be right on average, then the majority vote will be 99.999% likely to be wrong.</p>
<p>Systematic bias turns democracy&#39;s epistemic superpower into an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwc0S0WDDvk">idiocracy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="critical-thinking-to-the-rescue">Critical thinking to the rescue</h2>
<p>Humans have amazing cognitive abilities. We can compose concertos, paint works of art, and decipher complex languages. We can identify patterns in ambiguous data with amazing ease - faster and more accurately than even the best AI running on super-computers.  </p>
<p>We can beat the processing power of super-computers because we take cognitive shortcuts in many circumstances - rules of thumbs for decision making psychologists call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristics</a>.</p>
<p>But these same cognitive shortcuts also lead us to make errors when they are used in inappropriate settings. We overly discount distant outcomes, we assume events will be more like the near past rather than average past, and we substitute difficult problems for easy ones.</p>
<p>Importantly, these errors are systematic. People consistently repeat the same types of errors across a wide range of situations. This is what psychologists mean when they talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive biases</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully we can reduce or overcome these systematic biases through critical thinking. An explicit focus on thinking skills and metacognition in formal education and beyond can make us aware of our <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672002611010">cognitive biases</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167203262802">reduce them</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-018-0038-5">improve our logical reasoning</a>.</p>
<p>Critical thinking can also help us ask better questions in the first place.  Critical thinking helps us uncover our assumptions and reframe issues in ways that can take advantage of democracy&#39;s epistemic superpower.</p>
<p>This is why democracy requires critical thinkers. Critical thinking can help us overcome systematic biases in our reasoning by teaching us to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/what-is-critical-thinking-anyway/">make our own thinking the object of our analysis</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll never be perfect reasoners. But by learning to think critically, we can reduce or eliminate the systemic biases in our thinking processes. Then, democracy&#39;s epistemic superpower can do the rest.</p>

        <title>Why writing in the first person is a good thing</title>
        <description><p>The use of the word “I” in academic writing, that is writing in the first person, has a troublesome history. Some say it makes writing too subjective, others that it’s essential for accuracy.</p>
<p>This is reflected in how students, particularly in secondary schools, are trained to write. Teachers I work with are often surprised that I advocate, at times, invoking the first person in essays or other assessment in their subject areas.</p>
<h2 id="why-first-person-writing-is-important">Why first person writing is important</h2>
<p>An essential aspect of written communication is how we understand the object of the sentence and there are many occasions in which we wish to make ourselves, or at least our thinking, the object of concern. </p>
<p>When I am talking about the structure of someone else’s argument, or outlining or explaining their ideas, there is no need to make my thinking (which is to say me) the point. Even the evaluation of these arguments or ideas might be evaluations made by others, and so I again not a necessary part of the sentence (though, ironically, I am in these sentences). Consider the sentence, S1, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S1: “Bloggs (1980) claims that X is the case because of Y.  Biggs (1990), however disputes that Y is sufficient reason to support X since Z.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perfectly well expressed in a third person context.</p>
<p>In terms of making an original contribution to the debate, one could follow S1 with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S2: “Biggs’ reply is unconvincing, however, since his conception of Y is not the same as that of Bloggs, differing in the following way…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S2 is also written in the third person, so, all seems well in the third person camp.</p>
<p>Now consider S3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S3: “I find Biggs’ reply unconvincing, since his conception of Y is not the same as that of Bloggs, differing in the following way…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the difference between S2 and S3? As many people would appreciate, S2 fails to say who is unconvinced. This is a failure of both clarity and accuracy. And, of course, it resorts to the loathsome passive voice.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-lose-when-we-give-up-the-first-person-voice">What do we lose when we give up the first person voice</h2>
<p>This matters in teaching for thinking because it is the student’s thinking that is often what we are looking for in an essay or other work. Why is the student unconvinced? — the reasons then follow. </p>
<p>Another way of looking at this, is if I want my students&#39; thinking to be the object of my study, I need for them to make it the subject matter of their writing.</p>
<p>We say to students “evaluate/justify the claim or the argument”. In some subjects, that means look at what other people have said and use their arguments to arrive at a position. In that case, it is their analysis, but it is not their evaluation or justification. But teaching for thinking is not always like that, since we want students to make their own evaluations and justifications. Or at least much more overtly. Hence, we need to know what they think.</p>
<p>Notice that in what I have written so far, I have used first person singular, first person plural, third person singular and third person plural. So why say this is a ‘first person’ essay? The key idea is that the first person style is invoked as required, just as any other view is invoked when it is the object of the sentence.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Science and Nature, arguably two of the world’s best science journals, ask their authors to selectively avoid third person. From Nature: “Nature journals prefer authors to write in the active voice (&quot;we performed the experiment...&quot;)”. </p>
<p>They, like us, wish those writing for them to own what they say. I think the claim that third person is more objective is misleading, because sometimes students hide behind statements using the passive voice, with the claim of objectivity nothing more than a grammatical veneer (“it can be argued”, “some might say”, &quot;it was decided that” rather than “I argue”, “I claim that” and “I decided that X for the following reasons”).</p>
<p>So, I would say use of the first person grammatical position (as opposed to ‘writing an essay in first person’) is perfectly sensible and indeed desirable in teaching for thinking. As I often say to my students, I really don’t care what you think, but I’m deeply concerned with why you think it (ooh! second person).</p>

        <title>How students can collaborate online</title>
        <description><p>The first thing teachers usually worry about when teaching online is what programs to use and how to drive them. Figuring out what is possible and then how to do it can be very daunting, particularly if you&#39;re not at home with computers to begin with!</p>
<p>Once we learn how they all work, the next concern is getting a whole bunch of content uploaded so students can access it. This can include things like Powerpoints, worksheets, videos, weblinks and so on.</p>
<p>The last thing teachers usually worry about is pedagogy: wondering how to navigate the learning environment, which includes engaging with what and how students are thinking.</p>
<p>In face to face classrooms, there are a number of tried and true methods to make sure students are able to collaborate with the teacher and the rest of the class. I have spoken about the <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/the-how-and-why-of-collaboration-in-the-classroom/">importance of this elsewhere</a>. </p>
<p>But how can we do this online? Let&#39;s have a look at the kinds of tools that can move an online classroom from students passively receiving content to actively engaging in learning and thinking. I won&#39;t look at any particular program, but you can find these things in most online teaching platforms worth their salt.</p>
<h2 id="tools-of-collaboration">Tools of collaboration</h2>
<p>At one end of the scale we have students accessing prerecorded or uploaded content. This is one-way or &quot;asynchronous&quot; teaching. There is little to no interaction and it represents the poorest kind of collaborative online experience for students.</p>
<p>But it gets more interesting when you add a few features and move towards a more &quot;synchronous&quot; model. Let&#39;s look at these in turn ...</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="hands-emoticons-tick-cross-thumbs-up-thumbs-down-">Hands/emoticons/tick-cross/thumbs up-thumbs down.</h4>
<p>These allow students to let the teacher know how they are going in simple terms. They appear alongside the student names.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="public-and-private-chats">Public and private chats</h4>
<p>Students can write in a section of the screen, ask questions or make comments, or even answer questions asked by the teacher or another student. A nice function is that these chats can also be private between a student and a teacher, that is to say that the other students can&#39;t see it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="break-out-rooms-bors-">Break out rooms (BORs)</h4>
<p>BORs are great for allowing students to work with each other in small groups that are isolated from each other. They allow opportunities for all students to have a voice, which is sometimes hard in a full class. </p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="audio-video-interaction">Audio/video interaction</h4>
<p>If there is enough bandwidth, it might be possible for students to ask questions or make comments verbally and occasionally with video. This is sometimes good in BORs, where students can engage in more natural conversations and see each other&#39;s expressions.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="sharing-screens">Sharing screens</h4>
<p>When screens can be shared, it is sometimes much easier to get points across to the group. Teachers can usually share their screens and allow students to share theirs.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="interactive-whiteboards">Interactive whiteboards</h4>
<p>These devices allow students to draw or type in a common space that allows everyone to see how a group response shapes up. Used creatively these can capture and enhance collaboration. </p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="polling-tools">Polling tools</h4>
<p>Teachers can ask students questions and have the results collated and displayed to the group. They can also be done privately so that each student is not influenced by the response of the others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It pays to consider not only that these are available, but what they allow you to do in terms of student collaboration and sharing of thinking in the classroom that is a fundamental aspect of maintaining student engagement.</p>

        <title>What does a critical thinking activity look like?</title>
        <description><p>Recently, we looked at some of the <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/the-myth-that-critical-thinking-cant-be-taught/">confusion around critical thinking</a> and why this leads to claims that critical thinking can&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t, be taught in schools. </p>
<p>Now there are a number of approaches to teaching critical and creative thinking.  Many approaches to developing critical thinking are based on <a href="https://p4c.com/">Philosophy for Children</a>, a program that involves teaching the methodology of argument and focuses on thinking skills. </p>
<p>Other approaches are based on argument mapping using a pen &amp; paper or a digital platform like <a href="https://reasons.io">reasons.io</a>.  Others still provide this focus outside of a philosophical context.  </p>
<p>There is no &#39;one right way&#39; to teach critical and creative thinking in the classroom but rather, there are a rich diversity of effective pedagogies. So it might be useful to explore what a critical thinking activity in the class room actually looks like.</p>
<h2 id="a-useful-example-from-teaching-for-thinking-">A useful example from Teaching for Thinking.</h2>
<p>Teachers at one Brisbane school, who have <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">extensive training in critical thinking pedagogies from our Teaching for Thinking program</a>, developed a task that asked students to determine who is or was Australia’s greatest sportsperson.</p>
<p>Students needed to construct their own criteria for greatness. To do so, they had to analyse the Australian sporting context, create possible evaluative standards, explain and justify why some standards would be more acceptable than others and apply these to their candidates.</p>
<p>They then needed to argue their case with their peers to develop criteria that were robust, defensible, widely applicable and produced a choice that captured significant and relevant aspects of Australian sport.</p>
<p>This required students to not only consider what claims and justifications would be acceptable to themselves but importantly, what values and therefore justifications would be acceptable to others.  They had to not only consider other points of view but evaluate their own reasoning in the context of those other views.</p>
<p>Note that this deliberately application of critical thinking pedagogy in the classroom didn&#39;t involve a stand alone critical thinking activity or subject, nor did it take valuable time away from &#39;content learning&#39;. It was an activity embedded within the existing subject and content matter - one which both demanded an undertanding of, and motivated inquiry into, the subject&#39;s content matter.</p>
<p>Learning experiences and assessment items that facilitate critical thinking skills include any of those in which students can:</p>
<ul>
<li>challenge assumptions</li>
<li>frame problems collectively</li>
<li>question creatively</li>
<li>construct, analyse and evaluate arguments</li>
<li>discerningly apply values of inquiry</li>
<li>engage in a wide variety of cognitive skills, including analysing, explaining, justifying and evaluating (which creates possibilities for argument construction and evaluation and for applying the values of inquiry)</li>
</ul>
<p>In engaging in these activities students develop through necessity the ability to (among other skills) analyse, understand, explain, evaluate and justify. Not only do they <em>do</em> these things, they <em>understand</em> their nature and purpose. </p>
<p>It is this understanding that is most readily transferable between context but only if it becomes an <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/what-is-critical-thinking-anyway/">object of study</a> during the activity. With out this explicit attention the knowledge and skills that are in use remain vaguely defined and hence difficult to for students to utilise elsewhere.</p>
<p>Critically, this task also allows teachers to give feedback to students on the quality of their thinking as that thinking is happening in real time through discussion, questioning and peer-to-peer dialogue. It is a rich environment for applying <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/values-of-inquiry/">the values inquiry</a>.</p>

        <title>What is argument mapping and how can it help critical thinking?</title>
        <description><p>There are a number of possible ways to teach critical and creative thinking in the classroom.  One approach, very common in university undergraduate courses, is to teach critical thinking as a stand alone subject focusing on a range of concepts like psychology, informal logic, and argumentation.</p>
<p>Another approach, best realised in the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/children/">Philosophy for Children</a> movement, is to incorporate a small session (approximately an hour per week) of collaborative inquiry into the weekly class schedule. Alternatively, critical thinking can be integrated across the curriculum by making thinking an object of inquiry in all subjects, something we articulate in our <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/teaching-for-thinking/">Teaching for Thinking</a> program.</p>
<p>Regardless of the approach however, there are a range of tools and techniques that can help students think about their thinking.  And one such tool is <em>argument mapping.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-argument-mapping-exactly-">What is argument mapping exactly?</h2>
<p>Argument mapping is the visual representation of the inferential structure in our reasoning.  It&#39;s a way to show which claims justify what and how.  Argument maps provide a useful focal point to, and scaffolding for, our reasoning processes.</p>
<p>The visual nature of argument mapping makes it a very effective way of analysing the reasoning process around specific inferences.  It allows us to &quot;cut through&quot; the rhetoric skin of language and expose the underlining logical skeleton - something philosopher Tim van Gelder has described as &quot;<a href="https://doi.org/10.3200/CTCH.53.1.41-48">having x-ray goggles into students&#39; minds&quot;</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://criticalthinking.org.au/media/argument-map.png" alt="An argument map"></p>
<p>Argument mapping as a tool for improving our thinking has a <a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofjudi00wigm/page/754/mode/2up">pedigree that goes back over 100 years</a>. Recently however, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3200/CTCH.53.1.41-48">number of studies</a> have shown that argument mapping is one the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/h0085794">most effective ways</a> to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-018-0038-5">improve students&#39; cognitive skills</a> ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the critical thinking gains measured [from 6 months of argument mapping] are close to that which could be expected to result from three years of undergraduate education.</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.1154">Butchart <em>et al</em> (2009) p228</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-does-argument-mapping-work-">Why does argument mapping work?</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons that argument mapping has proven so useful as a thinking aid is that it forces us to confront our reasoning processes.  When we think to ourselves, we tend to think in associations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paris &lt;==&gt; France &lt;==&gt; Croissant &lt;==&gt; Yum!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These associations are multi-directional.  The idea of France might lead us to thoughts about croissants, or Paris, or both.  Paris in turn, might lead us to good wine, snooty waiters, and the Eiffel Tower.  </p>
<p>But the inferential process of argumentation is not. Inferring is a uni-directional process where we move from premises to conclusion.  The creative and divergent aspect of association is <em>very</em> different to the critical and convergent aspect of inference.</p>
<p>Then later, when we try to think out loud or on paper through language, we are constrained by the linear structure of narrative. We can start a story anywhere but one sentence must still come after another.  </p>
<p><em>Narrative is linear but our reasoning is not.</em></p>
<p>Argument maps don’t have that constraint. Argument maps are tree-like structures called directed graphs which more accurately represent good reasoning.  Importantly, argument maps show the direction of our inferences.</p>
<p>And this is where argument mapping really shines.  A critical thinker will have strong justifications for their beliefs. In written narrative or even symbolic logic, it is not clear how individual propositions support specific claims.  Argument mapping however, makes this explicit. As my colleague Peter Ellerton observes ... &quot;It&#39;s all about the arrows!&quot;</p>
<p>In this way, argument maps provide us with a scaffold to think about our thinking in a way that more accurately respects the norms of reason.  They force us to move beyond the mere association of ideas and make our thinking the object of inquiry.</p>

        <title>The Myth that critical thinking can&#x27;t be taught</title>
        <description><p>There is a steady beat of assertions that <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">critical thinking can’t</a>, <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-schools-should-not-teach-general-critical-thinking-skills">or shouldn&#39;t</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/lets-stop-trying-to-teach-students-critical-thinking-30321">be taught</a>.  My colleagues and I are putting together a paper to answer these claims in detail, but broadly speaking these revolve around quite limited ideas of what critical thinking is (<a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/main-education/teaching-and-learning/education-for-a-changing-world/media/documents/How-to-teach-critical-thinking-Willingham.pdf">you need it to play chess?</a>) and some quite odd inferences from similarly limited definitions and examples of critical thinking to the claim that it can’t be taught. </p>
<p>The data on this is very clear. Not only can <a href="https://doi.org/10.5840/thinking20051743">critical thinking be taught</a>; it is being <a href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.1154">taught successfully</a> in a number of programs in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-15462-011">Australia</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0267152042000248016">around the world</a>. What’s more, students who learn to think well do better on subject-based exams and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-018-0038-5">standardised tests</a> than those who do not. </p>
<p>But why would we think otherwise? There are a few key reasons for this, centred around conceptual mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-misunderstandings-about-critical-thinking">Conceptual misunderstandings about critical thinking</h2>
<p>One mistake is that research into teaching critical thinking often focuses only on short-term exposure to a limited range of thinking skills or concepts. When students are then tested and no real change is seen in their behaviour, the very long bow is drawn that critical thinking teaching doesn’t work. This is often found in narrow psychological approaches to research in critical thinking. </p>
<p>Another mistake is thinking that what works in learning content based knowledge works for learning to think well. <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441981257">John Sweller’s work in cognitive load theory</a> (CLT), for example, shows how important modelling problem solving is to student success.</p>
<p>But the erroneous assumptions of CLT include first that good thinking is made explicit and modelled by teachers with the appropriate pedagogical expertise. This is in fact not the case as the language and schematic understanding of teaching for thinking is seldom well-articulated.</p>
<p>A second assumption is that critical thinking is “biologically primary [meaning it is a fixed mental capability] and so unteachable”. This again mistakes critical thinking for intelligence or some other general, diffuse skill that is too broadly distributed or unitised by our brains to be educationally targeted. Teaching thinking is far more like coaching than instruction, and while you cannot coach for any significant increase in intelligence, the same is not true for critical thinking.</p>
<h2 id="is-critical-thinking-a-general-skill-">Is critical thinking a general skill?</h2>
<p>The claim that critical thinking is not a general skill, which I hear a lot, is fine. I’m not sure who is claiming that it is. Critical thinking is far more than a skill. It is a complex set of dispositions, knowledge and virtues that is built up with pedagogical care over time. It cannot be activated and transferable in minutes as if it was some pavlovian reflex. </p>
<p>You could say that it is transferable between contexts once the critical thinker has mastered a number of key concepts and has developed an appreciation about what is valuable in inquiry. But transferable does not mean the same thing as a general skill. </p>
<p>The Australian Curriculum has General Capabilities for a number of key areas, including critical and creative thinking. In their view</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...capability encompasses knowledge, skills, behaviours and dispositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim that critical thinking can&#39;t be taught often comes from areas of research in which these pedagogical concerns are not well addressed. Much of the material we provide on this project is intended to develop the understanding and resources needed to teach people to think well.</p>

        <title>What&#x27;s the role of argumentation in critical thinking education</title>
        <description><p>Critical Thinking is a broad church.  As an academic program, it draws from a wide range of disciplines including psychology, philosophy, and logic.  All these areas are important - descriptive psychology gives us insight into our cognitive biases and heuristics, philosophy helps us understand the nature of truth and helps to understand what it means to be rational, and logic provides the tools for making valid inferences.  </p>
<p>Yet amongst them, one area stands out as especially <em>critical</em> - argumentation. </p>
<p>When people hear the word argument, they often think of conflict.  Within the thinking domains however, an argument is simply a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDB5gbtaEQ&amp;t=1m25s">connected series of statements used to establish definite proposition</a>. </p>
<p>Argumentation then, is the study of how beliefs are justified via appropriate reasoning.  It&#39;s a theory of rational persuasion whereby we can accept certain claims as true if they are backed by a cogent argument.</p>
<p>To understand why argumentation is so essential to critical thinking, we need to consider why we value critical thinking in the first place.  A key objective in the <em>application</em> of critical thinking is to help ensure that our beliefs are warranted or justified. In other words, to ensure that our beliefs match reality or, in the absence of any way to confirm what the truth is, to stand confidently based on the  quality of our reasoning.</p>
<p>The account of what exactly justifies or warrants our beliefs comes from <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/">epistemology</a> - the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge.  So a useful way of thinking about critical thinking is as a form of <em>applied epistemology</em>.</p>
<p>Epistemology is a normative endeavour.  This means it is concerned with how we <em>should</em> think, as opposed to a descriptive one like psychology which studies how we <em>actually do</em> think.  It is epistemology that gives us the standards of rational inference, of testimony, and of evidence - the standards we need to answer questions like &quot;how do I know this is true?&quot; or &quot;which theory is the most plausible?&quot;.  </p>
<p>This normative component is essential because without it, we have no way of reconciling completing claims about what is or might be true.  Without it, all we can do is contradict each other when we disagree.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s in reconciling of disagreement that we can start to see argumentation connect the dots between the different subjects that inform critical thinking.  Argumentation links the normative aspect of epistemology with the social aspect of persuasion.  It gives us the tools to persuade others (and be persuaded ourselves) based on cogent reasoning rather than the tone, tempo, or volume of the person making the claim.</p>
<p>Argumentation is what makes social cognition so effective. </p>
<p>Given all this, it becomes clear that the effectiveness of any program that aims to promote critical thinking will be severely limited if it doesn&#39;t explicitly focus on student cognition and the norms of good reasoning.</p>
<p>If improving the ability of your students to think critically is important, then it&#39;s essential to <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/arent-we-already-teaching-critical-thinking/">think and plan in the language of student cognition</a>.</p>

        <title>The how and why of collaboration in the classroom</title>
        <description><p>Collaboration, and the reasons for it, is sometimes as poorly understood as the term &quot;inquiry&quot;. Collaboration does not simply mean a group of students working together and it certainly does not mean a group of students dividing a large task between them and reporting back to each other on its completion. </p>
<p>Collaboration is critical in developing thinking for the reason that learning to think well is a bit like learning to speak a language. Just like learning a language, you cannot learn to think well in isolation. You must do it with others to learn how to do it well. Reasoning is far better understood, in fact, as a <em>social competence</em> rather than an individual faculty. </p>
<p>Just as language is about creating shared meaning, so too is our common rationality. It is not enough that I give you my reasons as to why I think something is the case or ought to be the case. I must also make sure that those reasons are accessible to you. </p>
<p>I need to explain why this should matter given your circumstances, and ask that you do the same for me. We need to understand what this means for each other, because we do not all process information in the same way.</p>
<p>Collaboration is critical in at least five ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Collaborative thinking allows students to understand and develop the norms of effective thinking, just as the norms of language are understood through speaking with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thinking collaboratively is a form of social cognition, in which the limits of cognition are not those of the individual mind but of the group. This can be understood in two ways. First, that social cognition helps check the biases and assumptions held by individual minds, second that the outputs of one mind can act as inputs for other minds so forming a greater cognitive complex. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Creativity is a core component of critical thinking and this is best developed collaboratively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feedback is a necessary condition for improving experiential knowledge (knowing how). In collaborative inquiry, in which thinking is shared and communication is clear and direct, the interactions between participants provide opportunities for immediate and frequent feedback on the appropriateness and quality of student thinking, either from their peers or from the teacher. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Collaborative inquiry both collectively forms and models the norms of effective thinking allowing development in critical thinking to be guided and shaped. The internalisation of what we learn socially becomes available as a resource for individual, private thinking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So while it&#39;s possible for some students to develop the skills and dispositions of a critical thinker via individual learning, collaborative inquiry is the process that necessary to develop the essential skills of social cognition.</p>

        <title>What is Critical Thinking anyway?</title>
        <description><p>There are many different definitions of critical thinking. Some definitions suggest it&#39;s just about being able to solve problems or puzzles. Other definitions suggest that critical thinking really shines in complex discipline contexts. In other words, those people who are able to crack difficult problems must be good critical thinkers. </p>
<p>Because of this perceived connection between critical thinking and complex subject matter, there are also some definitions that equate expertise with critical thinking. It is possible, however, to be working in quite sophisticated areas without necessarily employing much critical thinking at all. Critical thinking is not just about thinking in context, it&#39;s also about making your thinking itself an object of study. </p>
<p>The thing that critical thinkers are most critical about the quality of their thinking. While it&#39;s true they may be thinking about their subject area, they are also aware of the inferences they are drawing, of the need to develop broader perspectives, of the desire for clarity, accuracy and precision in their work, of needing information to be both relevant and significant and so on.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-skills">Cognitive Skills</h2>
<p>Cognitive skills include justification, analysis, interpretation, synthesis, evaluation, explanation and identify. They also include creative skills such as, speculate, generate and hypothesise. it&#39;s important to realise that things such as problem-solving and decision-making are not cognitive skills as such. These things are processes that require cognitive skills, but are in themselves something different. To effectively solve problems or make decisions, we need skills such as analysis, evaluation and justification.  Problem-solving and decision-making are processes in much the same way that creativity is a process.</p>
<p>Teaching students how to use these cognitive skills requires much more than providing them with the definition of the skill. It even requires more than simply giving them examples of these skills action. We need to think of the teaching of cognitive skills as more like coaching than either defining or illustrating. In other words, we need to get students to do these skills so that we can feedback on how well they are being done.</p>
<h2 id="affective-dispositions-or-virtues">Affective Dispositions or virtues</h2>
<p>A disposition is a tendency to behave in certain ways under certain circumstances. Our hope is that our students that will develop a range of dispositions, or habits of mind, that make critical thinking a more reflexive action. But I would argue that dispositions or habits of mind are not enough. I do not want my students to simply be reactive or habitual. I wish them to behave in ways that sometimes may go against their dispositions or habits because they know that is how they ought to behave. Knowing why one ought to behave, or think, in a certain way best describes a virtue. </p>
<p>Critical thinkers are virtuous thinkers. The virtues we wish to create include open-mindedness, perseverance, tolerance of other ideas, resilience, intellectual honesty, intellectual humility and intellectual integrity. But how do we create these virtues through our everyday interaction with students in the classroom. This is a critical question that Teaching for Thinking aims to answer.</p>
<h2 id="values-of-inquiry">Values of Inquiry</h2>
<p>The things that we value about something give us the means of constructing criteria for evaluation. Value is the root of the word evaluation. But what do we value ineffective thinking? One way to answer this question is to realise that inquiry and thinking are inseparable. When we are thinking we are inquiring and when we are inquiring we are thinking. What we value in thinking is therefore what we value in inquiry. The things that we value in inquiry include values such as clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, breath, depth and coherence.</p>
<h2 id="metacognitive-evaluation">Metacognitive Evaluation</h2>
<p>There are, arguably, two criteria that must be met if we are to say that someone is thinking critically, or at least is capable of doing so. The first criteria is that we must be able to think about our thinking, to be aware of the kind of thinking we are doing. This is generally what we mean in education when we speak of &quot;metacognition&quot;. But it&#39;s not enough that we are aware of our thinking or simply give it some attention for our thinking to be called critical. We must also have the means to evaluate that thinking. We must be able to apply some kind of criteria or standards about what makes for good thinking and recognise bad thinking. </p>
<p>Critical thinking then is both metacognitive and evaluative.</p>

        <title>Thinking about thinking helps kids learn. How can we teach critical thinking?</title>
        <description><p>Few people doubt the value of developing students’ thinking skills. A 2013 survey in the United States found 93% of employers believe a candidate’s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important [the emphasis is in the original] than [their] undergraduate major. (<a href="https://www.aacu.org/leap/presidentstrust/compact/2013SurveySummary">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A focus on critical thinking is also common in education. In the Australian Curriculum, critical and creative thinking are known as “<a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/critical-and-creative-thinking/">general capabilities</a>”; the US has a similar focus through their “<a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2010/08/02/common-core-will-require-more-critical-thinking-from-students/">common core</a>”.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is being taught successfully in a <a href="https://impact.edu.au/student-programs/critical-thinking-series">number of programs</a> in Australian schools and universities and around the world. And various studies show these programs improve students’ thinking ability and even their standardised test scores.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-is-critical-thinking-and-how-can-we-teach-it-">But what is critical thinking and how can we teach it?</h2>
<p>There are many definitions of critical thinking that are vague or ill-formed. To help address this, let’s start by saying what critical thinking is not.</p>
<p>First, critical thinking is not just being smart. Being able to recognise a problem and find the solution are characteristics we associate with intelligence. But they are by themselves not critical thinking.</p>
<p>Intelligence, at least as measured by IQ tests, is not set in stone. But it does not seem to be strongly affected by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/brainstorm/201806/how-much-does-education-really-boost-intelligence">education</a> (all other things being equal), requiring years of study to make any significant difference, if at all. The ability to think critically, however, can improve significantly with much shorter interventions, as I will show.</p>
<p>Second, critical thinking is not just difficult thinking. Some thinking we see as hard, such as performing a complex chemical analysis, could be done by computers. Critical thinking is more about the quality of thinking than the difficulty of a problem.</p>
<p>So, how do we understand what good quality thinking is?</p>
<p>Critical thinkers have the ability to evaluate their own thinking using standards of good reasoning. These include what we collectively call the <a href="https://criticalthinking.org.au/values-of-inquiry/">values of inquiry</a> such as precision, clarity, depth and breadth of treatment, coherence, significance and relevance.</p>
<p>I might claim the temperature of the planet is increasing, or that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon is greater than it was last year. While these statements are accurate, they lack precision: we would also like to know by how much they are increasing to make the statement more meaningful.</p>
<p>Or I might wonder if the biodiversity of Tasmania’s old growth forests would be affected by logging. Someone might reply if we did not log these forests, jobs and livelihoods would be at risk. A good critical thinker will point out while this is a significant issue, it is <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-is-why-you-will-lose-your-argument-42679">not relevant to the question</a>.</p>
<p>Critical thinkers also examine the structure of arguments to evaluate the strength of claims. This is not just about deciding whether a claim is true or not, but also whether a conclusion can be logically supported by the available data through an understanding of how arguments work.</p>
<p>Critical thinkers make the quality of their thinking an object of study. They are sensitive to the values of inquiry and the quality of inferences drawn from given information.</p>
<p>They are also meta-cognitive - meaning they’re aware of their thought processes (or some of them) such as understanding how and why they arrive at particular conclusions - and have the tools and ability to evaluate and improve their own thinking.
How we can teach it</p>
<p>Many approaches to developing critical thinking are based on Philosophy for Children, a program that involves teaching the methodology of argument and focuses on thinking skills. Other approaches provide this focus outside of a philosophical context.</p>
<p>Teachers at one Brisbane school, who have extensive training in critical thinking pedagogies, developed a task that asked students to determine Australia’s greatest sports person.</p>
<p>Students needed to construct their own criteria for greatness. To do so, they had to analyse the Australian sporting context, create possible evaluative standards, explain and justify why some standards would be more acceptable than others and apply these to their candidates.</p>
<p>They then needed to argue their case with their peers to develop criteria that were robust, defensible, widely applicable and produced a choice that captured significant and relevant aspects of Australian sport.</p>
<p>Learning experiences and assessment items that facilitate critical thinking skills include those in which students can:</p>
<ul>
<li>challenge assumptions</li>
<li>frame problems collectively</li>
<li>question creatively</li>
<li>construct, analyse and evaluate arguments</li>
<li>discerningly apply values of inquiry</li>
<li>engage in a wide variety of cognitive skills, including analysing, explaining, justifying and evaluating (which creates possibilities for argument construction and evaluation and for applying the values of inquiry)</li>
</ul>
<p>One strategy that also has a <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ847457">large impact</a> on students’ ability to analyse and evaluate arguments is argument mapping, in which a student’s reasoning can be visually displayed by capturing the inferential pathway from premises to conclusion. Argument maps are an important tool in making our reasoning available for analysis and evaluation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/311514/original/file-20200123-162210-12kfhc7.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=243&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2" alt="This map shows part of an argument in favour of giving artificial flowers over real ones."></p>
<h2 id="how-we-know-it-works">How we know it works</h2>
<p>Studies involving a Philosophy for Children approach show children experience <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17535510">cognitive gains</a>, as measured by improved academic outcomes, for several years after having weekly classes for a year compared to their peers.</p>
<p>This type of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X15569530">argument-based intellectual engagement</a>, however, can show high outcomes in terms of the quality of thinking in any classroom.</p>
<p>Research also shows deliberate attention to the practice of reasoning in the context of our everyday lives can be significantly improved through targeted teaching.</p>
<p>Researchers looking at the gains made in a single semester of teaching critical thinking with argument maps said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the critical thinking gains measured […] are close to that which could be expected to result from three years of undergraduate education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students who are explicitly taught to think well also do better on subject-based exams and standardised tests than those who do not.</p>
<p>Our yet-to-be-published study, using verified data, showed students in years three to nine who engaged in a series of 12 one-hour teacher-facilitated online lessons in critical thinking, showed a significant increase in relative gains in NAPLAN test results – as measured against a control group and after controlling for other variables.</p>
<p>In terms of developing 21st century skills, which includes setting up students for lifelong learning, teaching critical thinking should be core business.</p>

        <title>Critical Thinking vs Content Knowledge</title>
        <description><p>Content knowledge is very valuable and is an essential part of the project of <a href="/teaching-for-thinking">Teaching for Thinking</a>. There is nothing about teaching thinking that minimises the importance of content. In this lesson we will try and better understand the relationship between content knowledge and thinking.</p>
<p>Previously, we looked at the concept of <a href="/understanding-and-expertise/">understanding</a> and saw that this involved relational knowledge. To understand something is to know how the elements of the concept hang together, how they relate to one another in a logical or causal manner.</p>
<p>Understanding is certainly a type of knowledge. To understand something is to know something, but a lot of the content outlined in syllabi is more straightforward than understanding. A lot of knowledge is the kind of knowledge that can be expressed or recalled in a sentence. </p>
<p>We call this knowledge “propositional knowledge”. Examples of propositional knowledge include that the capital of Australia is Canberra, some frogs are green, humans are bipedal, force equals mass times acceleration, and Socrates was born before Plato.</p>
<p>Much assessment is designed for students to demonstrate their propositional knowledge. (We also test their understanding by asking questions about the relationship between things and by giving them problems that require a particular understanding to solve.) Propositional knowledge is also often used to structure textbooks, plans for units of work and lesson design.</p>
<h2 id="the-rigorous-curriculum">The rigorous curriculum</h2>
<p>People sometimes think that a rigorous curriculum must contain lots of content, but this is a very poor way to understand what rigorous means. Rigour is far better associated with thinking than it is with content. </p>
<p>In fact, the best way to dumb down the curriculum is to cram it full of content, for this leaves no room for intelligent thinking. The quality of a curriculum cannot be determined simply by the breath or depth of the content it contains, we must also pay attention to the types of thinking skills that it is intended to develop.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-with-knowledge">What we do with knowledge</h2>
<p>All teachers are concerned with the knowledge development of their students. But I don’t know many teachers who are happy simply transmitting knowledge. One interesting definition of a good teacher is that they can take from all their discipline knowledge that which is developmentally appropriate to the students in front of them, logically and engagingly structure and sequence it, and test for understanding along the way. But this describes exactly the function of the textbook. </p>
<p><em>Teachers need to be more than textbooks.</em></p>
<p>Most teachers are also concerned with what students do with that knowledge. What students do with that knowledge is what makes them useful in any professional or vocational sense. If simply having access to knowledge was enough, then we’d just need to make sure that we had the information we needed handy. This could be done simply by accessing our phones. So simply having access to knowledge is not enough, we need to know what to do with it.  But doing things with knowledge is one of the things we mean by thinking. So, the extent to which we value doing things with knowledge is the extent that we value thinking.</p>
<p>We can see here the value of content, for without content we would not be able to practice and improve our thinking skills. But it is not enough that we are simply engaged with content to ensure that our thinking skills develop. </p>
<p>Our thinking skills will not develop unless we pay explicit attention to them in the classroom. An important point to make here is that as we are concerned with what students do with that knowledge in the classroom, we are using, reinforcing and developing the knowledge itself. </p>
<p>This demonstrates nicely the ideas of the of the philosopher John Dewey, who considered thinking as the “method of intelligent learning”. In fact, a focus on thinking, that is, what we do with the knowledge, delivers better learning outcomes in terms of knowledge acquisition and deeper understanding.</p>
<p>So, we need to value content and we need to engage with content. But the best way to engage with content is cognitively. We need to pay attention to the type of thinking we’re doing as we engage with the content as we develop our understanding and use that understanding to solve problems.</p>

        <title>Incorporating Critical Thinking into STEM Education</title>
        <description><p>Science and mathematics are an essential ingredient for developing students who can effectively participate in a complex and diverse 21st century society.  Current and future generations face a range of wicked problems that will require innovation and ingenuity to solve.</p>
<p>Yet as essential as STEM in eduction might be, it is far from sufficient.  Today&#39;s student&#39;s need to develop much more from their education than the ability to pipette peroxide, code software, build machines and solve equations.  They also need to think critically about what they are doing and why.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s no surprise that critical and creative thinking feature heavily in <a href="https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/critical-and-creative-thinking/">educational policy</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/employers-find-soft-skills-like-critical-thinking-in-short-supply-1472549400">the demands of employers</a>, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-intuitive-parent/201703/the-emerging-crisis-in-critical-thinking">wishes of parents</a>.</p>
<h2 id="asymmetric-transferability">Asymmetric transferability</h2>
<p>It would be convenient for everyone then (except perhaps for philosophers), if teaching students science also taught them to think critically.  </p>
<p>There must be some crossover.  After all, we teach differential calculus and Boyle&#39;s Law not because graduates need to perform optimisation by hand or calculate gas absorption on a daily basis but because this knowledge equips them with a useful perspective and ability to solve abstract problems.  </p>
<p>If it doesn&#39;t, what&#39;s the point of including things like this in a general secondary education?</p>
<p>Yet the evidence to support the claim that teaching scientific knowledge improves critical thinking <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024043708461">is</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5914/586">rather</a> <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo10327226.html">depressing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that critical and thinking and STEM are incompatible with each other.  Rather, content focused learning with a heavy reliance on memorisation and recall fails to effectively develop critical thinking skills. </p>
<p>Either we add critical thinking to the curriculum which requires us to remove some other subject (and who needs music and the arts anyway) or we must somehow integrate critical thinking into existing subject matter.</p>
<p>And given that the school day is already full, it seems sensible to look at the latter approach.</p>
<h2 id="disciplines-as-methods-of-inquiry">Disciplines as methods of inquiry</h2>
<p>We can begin to understand how we might integrate critical thinking into STEM subjects by viewing all subjects as particular approaches to inquiry.  </p>
<p>Physics asks different questions to history, chemistry uses different methods to psychology.  What makes a subject a subject is it&#39;s unique approach to investigate (including the kinds of questions they ask) but what makes all subjects common is that they seek to generate new knowledge.</p>
<p>Understanding the nature of knowledge and the justification of our beliefs is what critical thinking is all about.  It about <a href="/what-is-critical-thinking-anyway/">metacognition and evaluation</a> -- of thinking about our thinking and making judgments about its quality.</p>
<p>When we explicitly focus on metacognitive evaluation (when our thinking itself is an object of study) from within the context of subject matter, we are incorporating critical thinking into our teaching.  From this point of view, all subjects are just domain specific methods for understanding the world around us.</p>
<h2 id="question-then-justify">Question then justify</h2>
<p>There are a multitude of strategies that we might employ to develop critical thinking in STEM, but the simplest of them begin with questions.  Here are a few examples to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>What phenomenon are we investigating today?</li>
<li>Why might this be important?</li>
<li>What does the textbook say?</li>
<li>How do we know that&#39;s true?</li>
<li>What have we observed?</li>
<li>How accurate are our measures?</li>
<li>Does this amount of error matter?</li>
<li>How might we test our hypothesis?</li>
<li>What other hypotheses could also explain this data?</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these questions have simple yes/no answers.  Many are  better/worse style answers rather than right/wrong. Some can&#39;t even be answered by the best scientists today.</p>
<p>That can make them uncomfortable to ask (especially when you don&#39;t know the answer yourself). Yet this is also what makes them so transformative for student cognition.  They require students to analyse information, to evaluate it, and synthesise it into new beliefs -- the  key cognitive skills we are hoping to develop.</p>
<p>Asking and then answering these questions isn&#39;t enough however -- it&#39;s just the first step.  Students must also justify their responses to each other.  Without justification, a classroom discussion will quickly degenerate into empty talk-fest of preferences and taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> &quot;I think it&#39;s X.&quot;  </p>
<p> &quot;No, I think it&#39;s Y&quot;. </p>
<p> &quot;No, it&#39;s X!&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we begin to <em>ask</em> these question and <em>justify</em> our answers to our peers, we begin to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter we are investigating and the limitations of our knowledge.  We begin to reflect not just on <strong>what</strong> we know, but importantly on the <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> we know it.</p>
<p>Once we do that, we are beginning to think critically.</p>

        <title>Aren&#x27;t we already teaching critical thinking?</title>
        <description><p>Everyone seems to agree that critical thinking is an essential component of whatever list of 21st-century skills we might assemble. Other elements of this list include things such as creative thinking, entrepreneurship, problem-solving, decision-making, personal and social skills, and working collaboratively.</p>
<p>It is misleading, however, to think of critical thinking as simply one of a long list of essential skills. Critical thinking is better understood as underpinning all the other skills. Without critical thinking, for example, it is difficult to understand how we can have effective problem-solving or decision-making. Entrepreneurship also requires highly developed skills of analysis, evaluation and justification.</p>
<p>But not only does critical thinking underpin these other skills, those skills themselves are necessary for effective thinking. Creative thinking is a necessary component of effective thinking, and includes the constituent skills of generating and applying new ideas, identifying alternatives, and seeing or making new links.</p>
<p>Communication, collaboration and teamwork are fundamental to developing the norms of effective thinking, and collaborative or social cognition, as recognised by Vygotsky, Lipman, Kuhn and others, is recognised as a key step in improving individual cognition.</p>
<p>The personal and social skills that are necessary precursors to collaboration are also therefore a focus of an education in thinking. In short, T4T is a pedagogical focus on effective thinking does not just support the development of 21st century skills - it demands it!</p>
<h2 id="don-t-we-already-teach-students-how-to-think-">Don&#39;t we already teach students how to think?</h2>
<p>All discipline methodologies have critical thinking principles baked into them. That&#39;s what makes them effective as methods of inquiry. The methodologies have been constructed to be effective so they must have rational, critical components.</p>
<p>So isn&#39;t teaching maths or science or history enough to teach critical thinking?</p>
<p>The short answer is no! </p>
<p>Learning a discipline methodology doesn not mean that you understand the rationality behind it. Simply teaching students to solve complex problems within a discipline is not sufficient to ensure they are aware of the kinds of thinking that are necessary for the process or how that thinking can be improved.</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, without making these skills explicit it is very difficult to get students to transfer these abilities from one context to another. Content and disciplinary knowledge are necessary but insufficient conditions for teaching students to think critically.</p>
<h2 id="three-critical-questions-about-the-thinking-classroom">Three critical questions about the thinking classroom</h2>
<p>One way to assess how much your own classroom practice is focused on thinking is to ask your self these three questions - questions for which it is important that all educators have a good answer.</p>
<p>Please take the time to examine your own answers right now and reflect on how easy they were to answer. Write down your answers as we&#39;ll come back to them later.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>How do you know when students are thinking in your classroom?</strong></p>
<p>What kinds of activities do students engage in that indicate to you that they are thinking? Is it enough that they are talking with each other or asking questions of each other or of the teacher? What kinds of things do they say to each other? What kinds of questions are they asking? All of these issues are worth teasing out in some detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How you plan for that thinking to occur?</strong></p>
<p>Given that we might recognise the signs of students thinking, how do we plan for these things to occur?in what way is the consideration of student cognitive activity apparent in lesson and unit planning?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How do you give students feedback on the quality of their thinking?</strong></p>
<p>Once students begin to think, what kind of language do we have to speak with students about the quality of their cognition? Is it enough to simply check to see if a student gets the right answer, or to determine in a problem where they might have gone wrong? How is it that we can give them detailed and precise feedback on how well they analysed, justified or evaluated?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three questions are very useful to focus us on the task of Teaching for Thinking. I also recommend using these questions with your colleagues as you begin discussions with them and lead your own professional development teams.</p>

        <title>Understanding and Expertise</title>
        <description><p>The word understand is not always used very precisely. It is often seen in the phrase &quot;knowledge and understanding&quot;. But how is knowledge the same or different to understanding? Here&#39;s how we can understand that particular problem.</p>
<p>If I give you a list of people on a basketball team, it would not make sense to ask if you understood the list. You might realise that it&#39;s a list of basketball players, but that&#39;s about it. We don&#39;t use the word understand for such straightforward kinds of applications. If, however, we were to watch a basketball game, it would make sense for me to ask &quot;do you understand what you&#39;re seeing?&quot;</p>
<p>The reason this works is that understanding applies to relational knowledge - when elements of the thing were talking about are connected or related in certain ways. The names on the list are not very closely related to each other. The elements of a basketball game, however, such as the court markings, the ball, the hoop, the referee, the player and the crowd, are all interrelated. It is for elements with what we call a &quot;high degree of interactivity&quot; that the word understanding is usually reserved.</p>
<p>I might add that an implication of this is that the word understand does not represent a cognitive verb. Understanding is a state to be attained it is not an instruction that you can give to students in the same way that, for example, we might instruct students to justify or evaluate or identify or undertake any other cognitive task that we represent by a verb.</p>
<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>
<p>This definition of understand is important when we consider expertise. Experts have an understanding of their domain. They understand how all the elements of their area of speciality &#39;&#39;click&#39;&#39;or &quot;&#39;hang&#39;&#39; together. How they relate to each other and the dynamics of how the whole system works. We call such knowledge &#39;&#39;schematic&#39;&#39; knowledge, it is knowledge organised into a &#39;&#39;schema&#39;&#39;. Importantly, a knowledge schema for expertise also contains information about the kinds of problem that an expert finds in their domain, including knowledge about how these problems are solved. Expert knowledge then is not just about knowing lots of stuff, it&#39;s also about knowing how that all hangs together including knowledge about problem-solving.</p>
<p>The significance of this for teaching for thinking is that pedagogical experts require a knowledge schema that represents their understanding of the kinds of challenges and problems faced in the domain of teaching for thinking and how these challenges are met and these problems are solved.
Knowledge, whether for understanding or for the development of expertise, is core business in education.</p>
<h2 id="working-memory">Working memory</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of working with schematic knowledge is that using schematic knowledge requires very little working memory. Working memory is a very limited cognitive resource. We can only hold and manipulate a very small number of items of knowledge in our working memory. For example, if I ask you to remember the words scissor, fruit, book, dog, glass, light, and tape, and to recite them after 60 seconds, the success rate for most people would not be high. The words fade from our attention and memory and we lose both the content and their order quite quickly.</p>
<p>If students have to recall individual bits of information that, like the list of words above, seem unconnected, but are required to solve a problem, most of their cognitive effort goes to remembering that information rather than solving the problem. But knowledge that is laid down within a schema can be recalled with little or no use of working memory. It’s a kind of magic. Thinking with schematic knowledge is therefore far more effective than thinking with individual pieces of knowledge. Focusing, therefore, on student thinking, recognising the need to build effective schematic knowledge, means we will produce more effective learners.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-learning">Implications for learning</h2>
<p>We want students to develop an accurate understanding of concepts. We also want students to build this understanding schematically. In other words, we are laying the foundation for the future development of expert knowledge for our students. But the knowledge of how to do this requires expert understanding, which means pedagogical experts need to develop their own schematic understanding about teaching for thinking. Whichever way we look at it, building schematic knowledge is an essential part of the project of Teaching for Thinking. </p>

        <title>Minds still matter in education</title>
        <description><p>First of all, let me make it clear that I’m not suggesting we all become dualists. As far as we know at the moment, the human brain is a sufficient (and possibly necessary) condition for the human mind. But although we might acknowledge the material or causal connection between the mind and the brain happily enough, that doesn’t mean we talk about them in the same way.</p>
<p>Arguably, there are good reasons to separate them when speaking in educational contexts. In this post, I will offer some reasons that might make an objective, science-based study of the brain less significant than other forms of engagement with students’ minds. </p>
<p>When we talk about students’ brains we are speaking about an organ of the body. The study of the human brain, like the study of other human organs, is not primarily directed towards an understanding of any particular brain but an understanding of what they all have in common. A heart specialist is not a specialist in your heart, but in human hearts. </p>
<p>Granted the point of this generic understanding is to treat individual cases, but this can only happen after a range of inductive inferences are made from the specific to the general. It is not very scientific to work with n=1. Individual brains, therefore, are understood based on what we know about collective brains, either in how they conform with, or how they differ from, the norm. </p>
<p>In neuroscience, as in all science, experiments should be reproducible. Regardless of who is doing the investigating, we should all be able to get similar results from similar experiments. Your experience of doing the experiment should not be relevant to my experience of doing the experiment. So long as it is carried out under the same material conditions, that is all that matters. Technically, we say that science concerns itself with those things that are invariant under first person transformations. Being “invariant under first person transformation” just means our different subject experiences do not, and should not, influence the results.  </p>
<p>The ‘should not’ of the last sentence is interesting, however. What saying ‘should not’ really means is that it is not the business of science to investigate those things that are not invariant under first person transformations. But what kinds of things are those? </p>
<p>Our lives are a series of subjective experiences. In an important sense, that is all we have. Subjective experiences are those experiences that are in some ways unexaminable by others. How a banana tastes to me is unknowable by anyone else. We might hypothesis that all people taste bananas in the same way, but that does not explain the different reactions people have when they eat them. The philosopher Thomas Nagel’s essay &quot;What is it like to be bat?” makes the point that, despite knowing all there is to know scientifically about bats, no one can know what it’s like to be a bat. What it’s like to be a bat is not a question that science can answer. The same is true for all subjective experiences that humans have. No one can know what it is like for you. The claim is not really that we can not experience similar subjective sensations, or that there is no way for us to potentially understand it, or even that it is separate from any brain state, but rather that there is no way to empirically verify that it is the same experience. Science simply does not have the tools to measure such things. This is the so-called “explanatory gap” between the material world and the quality of subjective experiences that haunts many philosophers of Mind. </p>
<p>At this stage the reader may be ready to dismiss such claims using the following argument, or something like it: </p>
<ul>
<li>Premise 1: All mental states are derived from or equivalent to brain states. </li>
<li>Premise 2: Our subjective experiences, as mental states, are the result of what goes on in the brain, i.e. changes in brain states.</li>
<li>Conclusion: A sufficiently well-targeted neurological investigation into changing brain states is an investigation of subjective experience. </li>
</ul>
<p>[This argument conflates a variety of philosophical positions but my concern is not to be philosophically precise, only to provide a representation of many people’s thinking about brains and minds.]</p>
<p>Even if this argument is sound, however, it still misses the point. An investigation into the brain of a person having a clear and identifiable subjective experience is difficult to justify as providing information about what it’s like to have that experience. At best, it could only support through correlation that a reported experience is happening. An investigation into the brain is not the same as an investigation of the experience because, while an investigation into the brain can give you a full description of what is happening neurologically, it cannot give an equally full description of what it feels like. It is an investigation into a subjective experience in which the investigation itself (i.e. of the brain) is &#39;invariant under first person transformation&#39;, but it is not an investigation of what it feels like for the subject, which is not invariant under first person transformation. </p>
<p>This difficulty science has with subjectivity is a salient point since a student’s educational experiences are, definitionally, subjective ones. No teacher of any worth would imagine that all students in their classes will experience the same thing at the same time for each stage of a lesson. To believe such a thing is to believe that students are irrelevant to the learning process, and that the only thing that needs attention is the activity of the teacher, for this will determine the student experience in full. </p>
<p>What we must take as axiomatic, I suggest, is that the most important thing happening in a classroom at any given time is what is happening in a student’s mind. In other words, their subjective experiences. These experiences are not limited to their emotional reactions to events in the classroom, but include the active processes of building knowledge, constructing schematic understanding and making meaning of, and finding purpose in, their learning. Let me take this a step further and say that the act of thinking itself is a subjective experience. Thinking is something you do in as much as surfing is something you do. You can’t learn to surf from a book, and you can’t learn to think from one either. In both cases, you’ve got to get out and do the thing to get better at it. It is in large part experiential knowledge and, like all experiential knowledge, it cannot be achieved or understood solely through the exchange of objectively verifiable information. </p>
<p>Here, then, I make the distinction between speaking of brains and speaking of minds in educational contexts (I say ‘speaking of brains and minds’ rather than ‘brains and minds’ because I am concerned with a way of capturing different perspectives, not describing actual differences). When we talk of brains we are often talking of the results of our objective scientific investigations. When we talk of minds, we often mean that which contains understanding and makes meaning of a student’s subjective experiences. Both of these approaches are useful (and granted not mutually exclusive), but that does not mean that both of them are as well-grounded, at least not yet. The fact is we know far more about student’s minds than we do about their brains. Excellence in teaching predates neurological investigation. </p>
<p>There is a vast store of wisdom about student minds that should not be ignored or overshadowed by the results of empirical investigation of the brain. We would be making a grave error to dismiss brain research, but we do not know enough about the brain to provide a fully functioning pedagogical approach. Not just yet.  </p>
<p>Engaging with student minds also sounds much more acceptable (and possibly less invasive) than engaging with their brains. Speaking of minds helps to put students’ subjective experiences of knowledge construction and meaning-making at the centre of our pedagogical concerns. The insights of neuroscience are valuable and will continue to be productive and even transformative, but we should not be seduced by breathtaking images of brains in action to stop talking about minds. Not just yet. </p>
<p>While we harvest the findings of neuroscience, we should be cautious of their pedagogical implications. The field of neuro-education is an emerging one and, as such, is still sensitive to misinterpretation and to premature commodification, especially in areas such as education that are hungry for evidence-based practice. </p>
<p>A proper development of the discipline will require a sophisticated partnership between neurological and pedagogical experts, it can’t be a one-way flow of information. While we wait for the discipline to develop, we still have a plethora of empirical studies showing the value (or not) of a range of approaches and strategies. </p>
<p>This post is not, therefore, a call to abandon empirical research in education, only to not weaken our core pedagogical strength of engaging with and developing the minds of our students. Wasn’t that why we all became teachers to begin with?</p>

        <title>How to use critical thinking to spot false climate claims</title>
        <description><p>Much of the public discussion about climate science consists of a stream of assertions. The climate is changing or it isn’t; carbon dioxide causes global warming or it doesn’t; humans are partly responsible or they are not; scientists have a rigorous process of peer review or they don’t, and so on.</p>
<p>Despite scientists’ best efforts at communicating with the public, not everyone knows enough about the underlying science to make a call one way or the other. Not only is climate science very complex, but it has also been targeted by deliberate obfuscation campaigns.</p>
<p>If we lack the expertise to evaluate the detail behind a claim, we typically substitute judgment about something complex (like climate science) with judgment about something simple (the character of people who speak about climate science).</p>
<p>But there are ways to analyse the strength of an argument without needing specialist knowledge. My colleagues, Dave Kinkead from the University of Queensland Critical Thinking Project and John Cook from George Mason University in the US, and I published a paper yesterday in Environmental Research Letters on a <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f/meta">critical thinking approach to climate change denial</a>.</p>
<p>We applied this simple method to 42 common climate-contrarian arguments, and found that all of them contained errors in reasoning that are independent of the science itself.</p>
<p>In the video abstract for the paper, we outline an example of our approach, which can be described in six simple steps.</p>
<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XAp1Foj7BzY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="six-steps-to-evaluate-contrarian-climate-claims">Six steps to evaluate contrarian climate claims</h2>
<p>Identify the claim: First, identify as simply as possible what the actual claim is. In this case, the argument is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The climate is currently changing as a result of natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Construct the supporting argument: An argument requires premises (those things we take to be true for the purposes of the argument) and a conclusion (effectively the claim being made). The premises together give us reason to accept the conclusion. The argument structure is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: The climate has changed in the past through natural processes</li>
<li>Premise two: The climate is currently changing</li>
<li>Conclusion: The climate is currently changing through natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine the intended strength of the claim: Determining the exact kind of argument requires a quick detour into the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning. Bear with me!</p>
<p>In our paper we examined arguments against climate change that are framed as definitive claims. A claim is definitive when it says something is definitely the case, rather than being probable or possible.</p>
<p>Definitive claims must be supported by deductive reasoning. Essentially, this means that if the premises are true, the conclusion is inevitably true.</p>
<p>This might sound like an obvious point, but many of our arguments are not like this. In inductive reasoning, the premises might support a conclusion but the conclusion need not be inevitable.</p>
<p>An example of inductive reasoning is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: Every time I’ve had a chocolate-covered oyster I’ve been sick</li>
<li>Premise two: I’ve just had a chocolate-covered oyster</li>
<li>Conclusion: I’m going to be sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a bad argument – I’ll probably get sick – but it’s not inevitable. It’s possible that every time I’ve had a chocolate-covered oyster I’ve coincidentally got sick from something else. Perhaps previous oysters have been kept in the cupboard, but the most recent one was kept in the fridge.</p>
<p>Because climate-contrarian arguments are often definitive, the reasoning used to support them must be deductive. That is, the premises must inevitably lead to the conclusion.</p>
<p>Check the logical structure: We can see that in the argument from step two – that the climate change is changing because of natural processes – the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed by the truth of the premises.</p>
<p>In the spirit of honesty and charity, we take this invalid argument and attempt to make it valid through the addition of another (previously hidden) premise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: The climate has changed in the past through natural processes</li>
<li>Premise two: The climate is currently changing</li>
<li>Premise three: If something was the cause of an event in the past, it must be the cause of the event now</li>
<li>Conclusion: The climate is currently changing through natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding the third premise makes the argument valid, but validity is not the same thing as truth. Validity is a necessary condition for accepting the conclusion, but it is not sufficient. There are a couple of hurdles that still need to be cleared.</p>
<p>Check for ambiguity: The argument mentions climate change in its premises and conclusion. But the climate can change in many ways, and the phrase itself can have a variety of meanings. The problem with this argument is that the phrase is used to describe two different kinds of change.</p>
<p>Current climate change is much more rapid than previous climate change – they are not the same phenomenon. The syntax conveys the impression that the argument is valid, but it is not. To clear up the ambiguity, the argument can be presented more accurately by changing the second premise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premise one: The climate has changed in the past through natural processes</li>
<li>Premise two: The climate is currently changing at a more rapid rate than can be explained by natural processes</li>
<li>Conclusion: The climate is currently changing through natural processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This correction for ambiguity has resulted in a conclusion that clearly does not follow from the premises. The argument has become invalid once again.</p>
<p>We can restore validity by considering what conclusion would follow from the premises. This leads us to the conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conclusion: Human (non-natural) activity is necessary to explain current climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, this conclusion has not been reached arbitrarily. It has become necessary as a result of restoring validity.</p>
<p>Note also that in the process of correcting for ambiguity and the consequent restoring of validity, the attempted refutation of human-induced climate science has demonstrably failed.</p>
<p>Check premises for truth or plausibility: Even if there were no ambiguity about the term “climate change”, the argument would still fail when the premises were tested. In step four, the third premise, “If something was the cause of an event in the past, it must be the cause of the event now”, is clearly false.</p>
<p>Applying the same logic to another context, we would arrive at conclusions like: people have died of natural causes in the past; therefore any particular death must be from natural causes.</p>
<p>Restoring validity by identifying the “hidden” premises often produces such glaringly false claims. Recognising this as a false premise does not always require knowledge of climate science.</p>
<p><img src="/media/ct-flowchart.png" alt="Flow chart for argument analysis and evaluation"></p>
<p>When determining the truth of a premise does require deep knowledge in a particular area of science, we may defer to experts. But there are many arguments that do not, and in these circumstances this method has optimal value.</p>
<h2 id="inoculating-against-poor-arguments">Inoculating against poor arguments</h2>
<p>Previous work by Cook and others has focused on the ability to inoculate people against climate science misinformation. By pre-emptively exposing people to misinformation with explanation they become “vaccinated” against it, showing “resistance” to developing beliefs based on misinformation.</p>
<p>This reason-based approach extends inoculation theory to argument analysis, providing a practical and transferable method of evaluating claims that does not require expertise in climate science.</p>
<p>Fake news may be hard to spot, but fake arguments don’t have to be.</p>

        <title>How do you know that what you know is true? That’s epistemology</title>
        <description><p>How do you know what the weather will be like tomorrow? How do you know how old the Universe is? How do you know if you are thinking rationally? These and other questions of the “how do you know?” variety are the business of epistemology, the area of philosophy concerned with understanding the nature of knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Epistemology is about understanding how we come to know that something is the case, whether it be a matter of fact such as “the Earth is warming” or a matter of value such as “people should not just be treated as means to particular ends”.</p>
<p>It’s even about interrogating the odd presidential tweet to determine its credibility.</p>
<p>Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, history and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out.</p>
<p>Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours.</p>
<p>Epistemology, therefore, is concerned with the justification of knowledge claims.
The need for epistemology</p>
<p>Whatever the area in which we work, some people imagine that beliefs about the world are formed mechanically from straightforward reasoning, or that they pop into existence fully formed as a result of clear and distinct perceptions of the world.</p>
<p>But if the business of knowing things was so simple, we’d all agree on a bunch of things that we currently disagree about – such as how to treat each other, what value to place on the environment, and the optimal role of government in a society.</p>
<p>That we do not reach such an agreement means there is something wrong with that model of belief formation.
We don’t all agree on everything. Flickr/Frank, CC BY-NC</p>
<p>It is interesting that we individually tend to think of ourselves as clear thinkers and see those who disagree with us as misguided. We imagine that the impressions we have about the world come to us unsullied and unfiltered. We think we have the capacity to see things just as they really are, and that it is others who have confused perceptions.</p>
<p>As a result, we might think our job is simply to point out where other people have gone wrong in their thinking, rather than to engage in rational dialogue allowing for the possibility that we might actually be wrong.</p>
<p>But the lessons of philosophy, psychology and cognitive science teach us otherwise. The complex, organic processes that fashion and guide our reasoning are not so clinically pure.</p>
<p>Not only are we in the grip of a staggeringly complex array of cognitive biases and dispositions, but we are generally ignorant of their role in our thinking and decision-making.</p>
<p>Combine this ignorance with the conviction of our own epistemic superiority, and you can begin to see the magnitude of the problem. Appeals to “common sense” to overcome the friction of alternative views just won’t cut it.</p>
<p>We need, therefore, a systematic way of interrogating our own thinking, our models of rationality, and our own sense of what makes for a good reason. It can be used as a more objective standard for assessing the merit of claims made in the public arena.</p>
<p>This is precisely the job of epistemology.</p>
<h2 id="epistemology-and-critical-thinking">Epistemology and critical thinking</h2>
<p>One of the clearest ways to understand critical thinking is as applied epistemology. Issues such as the nature of logical inference, why we should accept one line of reasoning over another, and how we understand the nature of evidence and its contribution to decision making, are all decidedly epistemic concerns.
Just because people use logic doesn’t mean they are using it well.</p>
<p>The American philosopher Harvey Siegel points out that these questions and others are essential in an education towards thinking critically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By what criteria do we evaluate reasons? How are those criteria themselves evaluated? What is it for a belief or action to be justified? What is the relationship between justification and truth? […] these epistemological considerations are fundamental to an adequate understanding of critical thinking and should be explicitly treated in basic critical thinking courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour.</p>
<p>Engaging with deeper issues about the nature of rational persuasion can also help us to make judgements about claims even without specialist knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, epistemology can help clarify concepts such as “proof”, “theory”, “law” and “hypothesis” that are generally poorly understood by the general public and indeed some scientists.</p>
<p>In this way, epistemology serves not to adjudicate on the credibility of science, but to better understand its strengths and limitations and hence make scientific knowledge more accessible.
Epistemology and the public good</p>
<p>One of the enduring legacies of the Enlightenment, the intellectual movement that began in Europe during the 17th century, is a commitment to public reason. This was the idea that it’s not enough to state your position, you must also provide a rational case for why others should stand with you. In other words, to produce and prosecute an argument.</p>
<p>This commitment provides for, or at least makes possible, an objective method of assessing claims using epistemological criteria that we can all have a say in forging.</p>
<p>That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry.</p>
<p>The sincerity of one’s belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to “believe me” should not be rationally persuasive by themselves.
Simple appeals to believe have no place in public life.</p>
<p>If a particular claim does not satisfy publicly agreed epistemological criteria, then it is the essence of scepticism to suspend belief. And it is the essence of gullibility to surrender to it.
A defence against bad thinking</p>
<p>There is a way to help guard against poor reasoning – ours and others’ – that draws from not only the Enlightenment but also from the long history of philosophical inquiry.</p>
<p>So the next time you hear a contentious claim from someone, consider how that claim can be supported if they or you were to present it to an impartial or disinterested person:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>identify reasons that can be given in support of the claim</p>
</li>
<li><p>explain how your analysis, evaluation and justification of the claim and of the reasoning involved are of a standard worth someone’s intellectual investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>write these things down as clearly and dispassionately as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, make the commitment to public reasoning. And demand of others that they do so as well, stripped of emotive terms and biased framing.</p>
<p>If you or they cannot provide a precise and coherent chain of reasoning, or if the reasons remain tainted with clear biases, or if you give up in frustration, it’s a pretty good sign that there are other factors in play.</p>
<p>It is the commitment to this epistemic process, rather than any specific outcome, that is the valid ticket onto the rational playing field.</p>
<p>At a time when political rhetoric is riven with irrationality, when knowledge is being seen less as a means of understanding the world and more as an encumbrance that can be pushed aside if it stands in the way of wishful thinking, and when authoritarian leaders are drawing ever larger crowds, epistemology needs to matter.</p>

        <title>How to teach all students to think critically</title>
        <description><p>All first year students at the University of Technology Sydney could soon be required to take a compulsory maths course in an attempt to give them some numerical thinking skills.</p>
<p>The new course would be an elective next year and mandatory in 2016 with the university’s deputy vice-chancellor for education and students Shirley Alexander saying the aim is to give students some maths “critical thinking” skills.</p>
<p>This is a worthwhile goal, but what about critical thinking in general?</p>
<p>Most tertiary institutions have listed among their graduate attributes the ability to think critically. This seems a desirable outcome, but what exactly does it mean to think critically and how do you get students to do it?</p>
<p>The problem is that critical thinking is the Cheshire Cat of educational curricula – it is hinted at in all disciplines but appears fully formed in none. As soon as you push to see it in focus, it slips away.</p>
<p>If you ask curriculum designers exactly how critical thinking skills are developed, the answers are often vague and unhelpful for those wanting to teach it.</p>
<p>This is partly because of a lack of clarity about the term itself and because there are some who believe that critical thinking cannot be taught in isolation, that it can only be developed in a discipline context – after all, you have think critically about something.</p>
<p>So what should any mandatory first year course in critical thinking look like? There is no single answer to that, but let me suggest a structure with four key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>argumentation</li>
<li>logic</li>
<li>psychology</li>
<li>the nature of science.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will then explain that these four areas are bound together by a common language of thinking and a set of critical thinking values.</p>
<h2 id="argumentation">Argumentation</h2>
<p>The most powerful framework for learning to think well in a manner that is transferable across contexts is argumentation.</p>
<p>Arguing, as opposed to simply disagreeing, is the process of intellectual engagement with an issue and an opponent with the intention of developing a position justified by rational analysis and inference.
Arguing is not just contradiction.</p>
<p>Arguments have premises, those things that we take to be true for the purposes of the argument, and conclusions or end points that are arrived at by inferring from the premises.</p>
<p>Understanding this structure allows us to analyse the strength of an argument by assessing the likelihood that the premises are true or by examining how the conclusion follows from them.</p>
<p>Arguments in which the conclusion follows logically from the premises are said to be valid. Valid arguments with true premises are called sound. The definitions of invalid and unsound follow.</p>
<p>This gives us a language with which to frame our position and the basic structure of why it seems justified.</p>
<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
<p>Logic is fundamental to rationality. It is difficult to see how you could value critical thinking without also embracing logic.</p>
<p>People generally speak of formal logic – basically the logic of deduction – and informal logic – also called induction.</p>
<p>Deduction is most of what goes on in mathematics or Suduko puzzles and induction is usually about generalising or analogising and is integral to the processes of science.
Logic is fundamental to rationality.</p>
<p>Using logic in a flawed way leads to the committing of the fallacies of reasoning, which famously contain such logical errors as circular reasoning, the false cause fallacy or appeal to popular opinion. Learning about this cognitive landscape is central to the development of effective thinking.</p>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<p>The messy business of our psychology – how our minds actuality work – is another necessary component of a solid critical thinking course.</p>
<p>One of the great insights of psychology over the past few decades is the realisation that thinking is not so much something we do, as something that happens to us. We are not as in control of our decision-making as we think we are.</p>
<p>We are masses of cognitive biases as much as we are rational beings. This does not mean we are flawed, it just means we don’t think in the nice, linear way that educators often like to think we do.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to think of our minds as just running decision-making algorithms – we are much more complicated and idiosyncratic than this.</p>
<p>How we arrive at conclusions, form beliefs and process information is very organic and idiosyncratic. We are not just clinical truth-seeking reasoning machines.</p>
<p>Our thinking is also about our prior beliefs, our values, our biases and our desires.</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-science">The nature of science</h2>
<p>It is useful to equip students with some understanding of the general tools of evaluating information that have become ubiquitous in our society. Two that come to mind are the nature of science and statistics.</p>
<p>Learning about what the differences are between hypotheses, theories and laws, for example, can help people understand why science has credibility without having to teach them what a molecule is, or about Newton’s laws of motion.</p>
<p>Understanding some basic statistics also goes a long way to making students feel more empowered to tackle difficult or complex issues. It’s not about mastering the content, but about understanding the process.
The language of thinking</p>
<p>Embedded within all of this is the language of our thinking. The cognitive skills – such as inferring, analysing, evaluating, justifying, categorising and decoding – are all the things that we do with knowledge.</p>
<p>If we can talk to students using these terms, with a full understanding of what they mean and how they are used, then teaching thinking becomes like teaching a physical process such as a sport, in which each element can be identified, polished, refined and optimised.</p>
<p>In much the same way that a javelin coach can freeze a video and talk to an athlete about their foot positioning or centre of balance, a teacher of critical thinking can use the language of cognition to interrogate a student’s thinking in high resolution.</p>
<p>All of these potential aspects of a critical thinking course can be taught outside any discipline context. General knowledge, topical issues and media provide a mountain of grist for the cognitive mill.</p>
<p>General concepts of argumentation and logic are readily transferable between contexts once students are taught to recognise the deeper structures inherent in these fields and to apply them across a variety of situations.
Values</p>
<p>It’s worth understanding too that a good critical thinking education is also an education in values.</p>
<p>Not all values are ethical in nature. In thinking well we value precision, coherence, simplicity of expression, logical structure, clarity, perseverance, honesty in representation and any number of like qualities. If schools are to teach values, why not teach the values of effective thinking?</p>
<p>So, let’s not assume that students will learn to think critically just by learning the methodology of their subjects. Sure it will help, but it’s not an explicit treatment of thinking and is therefore less transferable.</p>
<p>A course that targets effective thinking need not detract from other subjects – in fact it should enhance performance across the board.</p>
<p>But ideally, such a course should not be needed if teachers of all subjects focused on the thinking of their students as well as the content they have to cover.</p>

        <title>Teaching how to think is just as important as teaching anything else</title>
        <description><p>A new paper on teaching critical thinking skills in science has pointed out, yet again, the value of giving students experiences that go beyond simple recall or learned procedures.  It is a common lamentation that students are not taught to think, but there is usually an accompanying lack of clarity about exactly what that might mean.</p>
<p>There is a way of understanding this idea that is conceptually easy and delivers a sharp educational focus – a way that focuses on the explicit teaching of thinking skills through an inquiry process, and allows students to effectively evaluate their thinking.
What are thinking skills?</p>
<p>Let’s first understand what we might mean by thinking skills. Thinking skills, or cognitive skills, are, in large part, things you do with knowledge. Things like analysing, evaluating, synthesising, inferring, conjecturing, justifying, categorising and many other terms describe your cognitive events at a particular functional level.</p>
<p>Analysis, for example, involves identifying the constituent elements of something and examining their relationships with each other and to the whole. One can analyse a painting, a piece of text, a set of data or a graph.</p>
<p>Analysis is a widely valued cognitive skill and is not unique to any discipline context. It is a general thinking skill.</p>
<p>Most syllabuses from primary to tertiary level are organised by content only, with little mention of such cognitive skills. Usually, even if they are mentioned, little is said about how to teach them. The hope is they will be caught, not taught.</p>
<p>Rigour in course design is too often understood as equating to large amounts of recall of content and specific training in algorithms or set procedures. It is far less common, but far more valuable, to have courses in which rigour is found in the demand for high-level cognitive skill formation.</p>
<p>This is not to say that knowledge is not important in the curriculum. Our knowledge is hard won; we should value what we have learned for how it makes our lives more productive or meaningful.</p>
<p>But there is nothing mutually exclusive about developing high levels of cognitive skills with content knowledge in a discipline context. It just demands attention to these skills, using the content as an opportunity to explore them.
Focusing only on the skill of recall does not produce effective thinkers. CollegeDegrees360/Flickr</p>
<p>It is knowing how to provide students with these skill-building opportunities in context that is the mark of an outstanding teacher of effective thinking.</p>
<p>After all, we do not expect the scientific, cultural and political leaders of tomorrow simply to know stuff. They must also know what to do with it.
Why inquiry is necessary</p>
<p>These skills are not something students can learn just by hearing about them. They need to be given experiences in which they are required to do them. The cognitive skills involve a learning how, not just a learning that.</p>
<p>This is why it’s not possible to develop effective thinkers by relying on didactic teaching methods, in which students are seen as passive recipients of the knowledge passed down by the teacher.</p>
<p>Just as it’s impossible to learn how to surf without getting on a board, it’s impossible to master cognitive skills unless you experience the need to use them.</p>
<p>Inquiry learning provides these necessary experiential opportunities.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which inquiry is understood educationally, and it usually describes a very broad approach characterised by a focus on active student involvement in the learning process.</p>
<p>Let me provide a narrower educational definition: inquiry is a process in which students are required to utilise a range of cognitive skills to formulate and solve problems.</p>
<p>An example of a task that requires only a narrow range of cognitive skills might be one that gets students to apply a learned procedure to construct a piece of art or experimental apparatus. The cognitive skills involved might include recall with some simple application.</p>
<p>If students were asked to evaluate existing examples of the above, with a view to modifying them to suit particular purposes or situations, and to explain their processes in doing so, then the skills of conjecture, analysis, evaluation, justification and communication can come into play.</p>
<p>The second example is more indicative of inquiry learning as a result of its demand for deeper and broader use of cognitive skills.</p>
<p>Let me also add another proviso, particularly to the end of developing good thinkers: to effectively learn to inquire, students must be aware of the cognitive processes they are experiencing. That is, they must be aware of their thinking - they must be metacognitive.
Talking about thinking</p>
<p>To think about our thinking, we must be able to talk about our thinking.</p>
<p>The cognitive skills describe our thought processes and hence provide a language in which we can discuss our thinking, at least in terms of learning to think well. This also provides a language in which to give students feedback on how they are going.
Good thinkers need to think about their thinking. Candace/flickr</p>
<p>To stick with the example of analysis, we might say that an analysis was quite broad, but did not go deeply enough, or that it analysed some areas in depth, but did not extend to all elements.</p>
<p>Students can use such feedback reflectively and internalise this advice to develop their own autonomous systems of evaluation. Metacognition is therefore a necessary condition for students to improve their thinking.</p>
<p>Moving our educational focus from knowledge to inquiry allows for the development of effective thinking. Inquiry requires students to build strong cognitive skills that extend beyond simple recall or application of learned procedures into genuine critical thinking.</p>
<p>No school could teach students all the knowledge they need to survive in a rapidly evolving society. But we could teach them how to think in a way that works for the knowledge they will learn in the future.</p>
<p>That’s what learning for life really means.</p>
