        <title>How do you know that what you know is true? That’s epistemology</title>
        <description>
How do you know what the weather will be like tomorrow? How do you know how old the Universe is? How do you know if you are thinking rationally? These and other questions of the “how do you know?” variety are the business of epistemology, the area of philosophy concerned with understanding the nature of knowledge and belief.</description>

        <title>How to teach all students to think critically</title>
        <description>
All first year students at the University of Technology Sydney could soon be required to take a compulsory maths course in an attempt to give them some numerical thinking skills.</description>

        <title>How to use critical thinking to spot false climate claims</title>
        <description>
Much of the public discussion about climate science consists of a stream of assertions. The climate is changing or it isn’t; carbon dioxide causes global warming or it doesn’t; humans are partly responsible or they are not; scientists have a rigorous process of peer review or they don’t, and so on.</description>

        <title>Minds still matter in education</title>
        <description>
First of all, let me make it clear that I’m not suggesting we all become dualists. As far as we know at the moment, the human brain is a sufficient (and possibly necessary) condition for the human mind. But although we might acknowledge the material or causal connection between the mind and the brain happily enough, that doesn’t mean we talk about them in the same way.</description>

        <title>Teaching how to think is just as important as teaching anything else</title>
        <description>
A new paper on teaching critical thinking skills in science has pointed out, yet again, the value of giving students experiences that go beyond simple recall or learned procedures.  It is a common lamentation that students are not taught to think, but there is usually an accompanying lack of clarity about exactly what that might mean.</description>

        <title>Why you don&#x27;t have the right to be taken seriously</title>
        <description>
In an age of fake news and social media echo chambers, Dr Peter Ellerton argues that while all people are worthy of respect, not all ideas deserve the same treatment. ​By separating our ideas from our identities, we are able to look at ideas through the lens of a brutal meritocracy, where we can discriminate between a good or bad idea without disrespecting the person who delivered it. </description>
